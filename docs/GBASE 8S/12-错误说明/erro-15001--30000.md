-16300	Identifier is too long.

An identifier in this statement is too long for its context. Check if
you have omitted a separator between two identifiers, or select a
shorter identifier.


-16301	A syntax error has occurred.

A syntax error has been detected in a Debugger command. Check that you
have not misspelled or omitted a keyword or identifier, included an
extra command argument, or placed keywords out of sequence. Check if
you have omitted parentheses after a function name in a CALL command or
included them in a VIEW command. To display a two-page synopsis of all
the commands, enter help all.


-16302	An illegal character has been found in the command.

Characters in Debugger commands are restricted to letters, numbers,
blanks, underscores, and the special characters that are listed in the
section "Conventions for Command Syntax Notation" in the Debugger
manual. You might have pressed a key inadvertently, or you might have
introduced illegal characters when you edited a file that provided
input to a READ command. If you create or modify a .4db file with a
word-processing program, be sure to save it in nondocument or text-only
mode.


-16303	An illegal integer has been found in the command.

Your expression or search pattern includes a numeric string of more
than 50 characters. Repeat the command, specifying a shorter expression
or search pattern.


-16304	An illegal floating point number has been found in the command.

Your expression or search pattern includes a floating-point numeric
string of more than 50 characters or includes more than one decimal
point. Repeat the command, specifying a shorter expression or search
pattern, or fewer decimal points.


-16305	Memory allocation failed.

Not enough system memory is available to execute your command. Repeat
the command at another time, when other users are making smaller
demands on system memory. On DOS systems, you will need to free some
disk space.


-16306	Found a quote for which there is no matching quote.

You might have omitted a quotation mark from a name or string, or
included an extraneous quotation mark. Repeat the command, using an
even number of single (') or double (") quotes.


-16307	Quoted string is too long.

The maximum length of a quoted string is 256 characters. Repeat the
command with a shorter string.


-16308	Missing function name.

You must specify the name of a function in a CALL command. Repeat the
command, specifying the name of a function followed by left and right
parentheses. If the function requires arguments, include the list of
arguments within the parentheses, separating multiple arguments by
commas.


-16309	Internal buffer limit exceeded.

Your command has too many characters. A Debugger command can include no
more than 256 characters. If you are specifying an ALIAS, BREAK, or
TRACE command that includes many command lines within braces, you might
consider using nested aliases. You can cause a function key or a short
string to stand for hundreds of keystrokes by specifying it as the
alias of a list of aliases, each of which represents fewer than 256
characters. Another alternative is to use READ commands, rather than
aliases, to enter multiple commands.


-16310	Keyword expected.

You have omitted a required command option. Enter help all to display
the names of all the Debugger commands or refer to the manual.


-16311	Command name is not recognized.

You have misspelled the name of the command or improperly abbreviated
it. Enter help to see a display of the names of all the Debugger
commands. If the string name appears to be a valid command name, you
might have also pressed a nonprinting key when you entered it.


-16312	Missing or misplaced = sign.

The LET command always requires an equal sign (=) as does ALIAS
without the asterisk option. Repeat the command and be sure to use the
equal sign in the appropriate place.


-16313	Missing module line number.

In a BREAK or TRACE command, you specified the name of a module,
followed by a dot, followed by a noninteger. The module name must be
followed by a dot and a line number that is an integer.


-16314	Missing filename.

If the Debugger is already loaded, you have not specified a filename
after a READ command or after a command to redirect output to a file.
Repeat the command, specifying the name of an input or output file.

If you were at the system prompt, you used the -F command-line option
to invoke the Debugger, but you did not specify the name of an
initialization file. Repeat the command, but this time either omit the
-F option or specify the name of a .4db initialization file following
the -F option.


-16315	Missing ).

Either you omitted a right parenthesis from a command argument, or you
included a superfluous left parenthesis.


-16316	A small integer is expected.

You must supply a positive or negative integer as an argument of a GROW
command. Repeat the command, specifying the number of lines to be added
to the size of the window. The sum of this integer and the current size
must be in the range from 1 to L-6, where L is the number of lines that
your terminal can display (often 24).


-16317	Program variable name expected.

A Debugger LET command requires three arguments:

    *   The identifier of a program variable

    *   An equal sign (=)

    *   An expression whose value is assigned to the variable

The identifier could not be recognized in the command that you
entered.


-16318	Positive number or name expected.

The ENABLE, DISABLE, NOBREAK, and NOTRACE commands all require an
argument. This argument can be a breakpoint or tracepoint name,
reference number, function name, or the ALL option. If the argument
that you entered in the Command window looks valid, you might have also
pressed a nonprinting key.


-16319	Internal error - illegal command.

This message reflects an unexpected condition in the command-parsing
module of the Debugger. If the error recurs, note all
circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-16320	Missing left brace.

You must use left and right brace characters ({ and }) in balanced
pairs.


-16321	Alias alias-name is an existing command keyword.

The name of an alias cannot be the complete form of a Debugger
command. (However, you can assign an abbreviated form of a command
keyword as an alias.) Repeat the command using another alias
identifier.


-16322	Missing directory list.

You used the -I command-line option when you invoked the Debugger, but
you did not specify a source-file search path. Repeat the command, and
either omit the -I option or specify a search path with it.


-16323	User cannot specify more than one directory list.

You can use the -I option only once on the command line. However, you
can specify more than one search path in the list following -I. Repeat
the command, listing all the desired source-file search paths,
separated by commas, following a single -I option.


-16324	User cannot specify more than one file name.

You can use the -F option only once on the command line. Repeat the
command specifying only one initialization file. After the Debugger
starts, you can enter READ commands to execute additional .4db files.


-16325	Missing or extra parameter.

You omitted or repeated a command-line option. Repeat the command after
you check the description of the fgldb command in the Debugger manual.

This message also appears if you attempt to pass parameters to the
program that is being debugged. The correct way to give command-line
parameters to the subject program is to include them with the run
command when you start the program.


-16326	Missing program name.

If you invoke the Debugger at the system prompt, you must include as an
argument the name of a compiled 4GL program (or else, in UNIX, use the
option -V to indicate that you want a display of only the software
version number). Repeat the command, specifying the name of a compiled
program this time.


-16327	Cannot locate file filename.

Possibly you omitted or misspelled the filename of a .4db input file
(either in a READ command or following the -F command-line option), or
you misspelled the filename or pathname of a .4gl source file in a VIEW
command or on the command line.

If filename is spelled correctly and names a file that exists, then you
might need to specify a complete pathname. You must specify the full
pathname of a file when you refer to a .4db file that is not in the
current directory, or to a .4gl source file that is not in the 
current directory or any directory that you specify with the 
-I command-line option.


-16328	Cannot read initialization file filename.

Although the Debugger found the file that you specified with the -F
parameter, it encountered an error when it tried to read from the
file. Check for operating-system error messages that might provide
more details. If the problem is not a hardware error, make sure that
your account has read access to the file (for instance, by displaying
its contents).


-16329	Pathname too long.

The Debugger will accept pathnames of up to 70 characters.


-16330	Cannot open file filename for reading.

Make sure that you specified the correct filename in your READ or VIEW
command, or after the -F option when you invoked the Debugger from the
command line. If the name was correct, the file might be damaged or
read protected. If you do not have permission to read it, refer to the
discussion of access privileges in your operating-system documentation,
or contact your system administrator.


-16331	Too many recursive aliases.

In some debugging tasks, aliases that reference other aliases can save
time or circumvent limits on the number of characters in a Debugger
command line. For example, you can specify alias1 to be a substring of
alias2, which can be a substring of alias3, and so forth up to alias5.
However, you cannot specify more than five levels of aliases between
your keystrokes and the fully expanded commands for which they stand.


-16332	Duplicate function name function-name.

The function name shown was found in a module that was being loaded.
However, a function of that name had already been seen in a module that
was loaded earlier. This situation is not allowed. Change the
application so that all functions in it have unique names.


-16333	Duplicate module name module-name.

The module whose name is shown is being loaded, but a module of that
name had already been loaded. Use the Program menu of the Programmer's
Environment to make sure that the program that is being debugged is
composed of only one copy of each module.


-16334	Internal error - null keyword encountered.

This message reflects a condition that was expected never to occur. If
the error recurs, note all circumstances and contact
GBase Technical Support.


-16335	Window can't be adjusted by number of lines specified.

The minimum number of lines in the Source window or in the Command
window one, not counting the Source window line that displays the
current module name. On a standard 24-line terminal, the maximum number
of lines in either window is 18, or L-6 where L is the number of lines
that the terminal supports.

The argument of a GROW command is not the new window size but the
increment to the current window size. To change the size of a window in
the Debugger screen, enter a GROW command to produce window sizes
within this range.


-16336	User must specify source file to view.

The VIEW command requires the name of a 4GL source file.


-16337	No previous search pattern.

You cannot enter a Search command without specifying a search pattern,
unless earlier in the same debugging session you specified a search
pattern. Repeat the command, specifying a valid search pattern.


-16338	Cannot continue execution.

You cannot invoke CONTINUE or STEP commands unless a 4GL program has
begun (but not terminated) execution. If the program is terminated
normally or by a fatal error, use CALL or RUN. After execution begins,
you must then suspend execution by a breakpoint (or, in UNIX
environments, by an Interrupt command) before you can invoke CONTINUE
or STEP. See also the section on "Active Functions and Variables" in
the Debugger manual.


-16339	Break or trace name name is not unique.

A name that you assign to a breakpoint or tracepoint in a BREAK or
TRACE command cannot duplicate the name of any existing reference point
(including disabled breakpoints or tracepoints). This message will also
appear after a READ command that sets a named breakpoint or tracepoint
if you read the same input file twice.


-16340	Invalid backslash encountered.

Your command includes a backslash symbol that cannot be interpreted as
a command-line continuation symbol. Repeat the command without invalid
backslashes.


-16341	Line number line-number not in specified module.

Your BREAK or TRACE command cannot specify a line number that is
greater than the line number of the last executable statement in the
specified module. If you specified no module name, the line number
cannot be greater than the last executable statement in your current
module. Check that you specified the correct module and line number.


-16342	Internal error - cannot set breakpoint.

If this internal error recurs, note all circumstances and
contact GBase Technical Support.


-16343	Invalid module name module-name specified.

You specified a module that is not part of the current 4GL
program.Possibly you misspelled the name, or you are confusing the
names of modules or functions from different programs. Repeat the
command, specifying a valid name.


-16344	Invalid function name function-name specified.

You specified a function that is not part of the current 4GL program.
Possibly you misspelled the name, you are confusing the names of
modules or functions from different programs, or you neglected to
compile a program module that contains this function. Repeat the
command, specifying a valid name.


-16345	Cannot set breakpoint in 4GL library function or user C function.

You can set a breakpoint only at a function written in 4GL, not at a
function that is written in another language such as C or ESQL/C, and
not at the name of a built-in function.

To suspend program execution when a C function is called, set a
breakpoint by specifying the line number of the 4GL statement that
calls the C function, rather than specifying the name of the function.


-16346	Cannot open output file filename.

Check if the output file already exists but is damaged or write
protected. In UNIX, check that you have permission to write in the
specified directory (or in the current directory if you specified no
pathname).


-16347	Invalid breakpoint or tracepoint number or reference name specified.

You cannot specify a reference number in an ENABLE, DISABLE, NOBREAK,
or NOTRACE command with a zero or negative value, or a value for which
no corresponding breakpoint or tracepoint currently exists. You can
enter list break trace to display your current reference numbers.


-16348	Breakpoint or tracepoint name is not active.

You asked the DISABLE command to deactivate a breakpoint that is
already disabled. Check that you named the breakpoint that you
intended. You can enter list break trace to display your current
breakpoints and tracepoints.


-16349	Use nobreak for breakpoints and notrace for tracepoints.

You specified a breakpoint to the NOTRACE command or a tracepoint to
the NOBREAK command. Each command can deal only with its own objects.


-16350	Breakpoint/tracepoint already disabled/enabled or can't be determined.

The Debugger cannot find a corresponding breakpoint or tracepoint on
which to carry out your ENABLE or DISABLE command. You can enter list
break trace to display all your current reference points.


-16351	Variable variable-name could not be located.

The Debugger cannot reference a variable unless it is defined in a 4GL
module. For 4GL variables, check that you entered the variable name
correctly. If the variable is not in the current function or module,
you must qualify its name. See the section on "Scope of Reference" in
the Debugger manual. (This message can appear if you enter what you
intend to be a module name in a BREAK or TRACE command, but you omit
the dot at the end of the name.)


-16352	File filename has been modified. (.4gl is newer than .4go).

The Debugger executes the .4go module, but it displays lines from the
.4gl source file. Because the source file has been changed since the
module was compiled, the lines that the Source window displays might
not correspond to the statements in the compiled program.

If you change the source code in a .4gl file, you must recompile it. If
your program includes several modules, you must also concatenate the
compiled modules before you start debugging. Also check if files exist
with both the .4go and .4gi suffixes for this program. Even if your
.4go file is the appropriate recompiled version, the Debugger first 
attempts to interpret the .4gi version.


-16353	Executable command is invalid when executing tracepoint commands.

The list of command lines in your TRACE command includes a CALL,
CONTINUE, RUN, or STEP command. These commands are not supported within
a TRACE command.


-16354	Function function-name not found.

You specified a function that is not part of the current 4GL program.
Check if you have misspelled the name or if you are confusing the names
of functions from different programs. Make sure that your 4GL source
code defines and calls the function that you want to execute.


-16355	Function function-name requires parameters.

The function that the CALL command names is defined as taking one or
more parameters. You must enter a matching number of parameters in the
parentheses following the name of the function. If you are not sure
what parameters should be passed to the function, use a VIEW command to
display its source code.


-16356	Too many parameters passed to function function-name.

Your argument list in a CALL command includes more parameters than the
function is defined as receiving. If you are not sure how many
parameters should be passed to the function, you can use a VIEW command
to display the source code of the function.


-16357	Function function-name is not active.

You can display only variables that are defined in the active function.
This variable is defined in function name, which is not active.


-16358	Variable name expected.

A LET command requires as its first argument a variable name. Do not
put quotes around the name.


-16359	Cannot assign values to records; Assignments must be to record members.

A LET command can assign a value to a simple variable or to a specific
member of a record, but not to a whole record.


-16360	Cannot assign values to arrays; Assignments must be to array elements.

A LET command can assign a value to a simple variable or to a single
element of an array that a subscript in brackets designates. Enter help
let to see an example.


-16361	Invalid variable name variable-name.

The identifier variable-name is not the name of a variable. The
VARIABLE command requires the name of a variable. Check the spelling of
the name.


-16362	No current function.

No current 4GL function exists if you have not yet invoked a RUN or
CALL command. Even after RUN or CALL, no current function exists if
execution terminated normally, rather than being stopped by a
breakpoint, by an Interrupt or STEP command, or by a fatal error. Use
RUN or CALL to begin or restart program execution.


-16363	Variable in function function-name is not active.

You named a variable whose value is assigned by a function that has not
yet been called or by a function that has already returned. A LET or
PRINT command can refer to only an active variable; that is, one global
or assigned in a function that is currently executing (a function that
a WHERE command lists). When you enter a CALL command, you must
substitute a literal value for an expression that needs an inactive
variable.


-16364	Unknown option option.

The Debugger cannot identify an argument option in your command. Repeat
the command, specifying option differently. Enter help turn to display
the many options of TURN.


-16365	Breakpoint or tracepoint name is already active.

The ENABLE command has no effect on breakpoints or tracepoints that are
already enabled. Check that you entered the name or reference number
that you intended. If you did, and you still feel that name should have
been inactive, use list break trace or search the command buffer to see
if a previous DISABLE command deactivated the wrong breakpoint or
tracepoint.


-16366	Error occurred while trying to write to a file.

Either your file system is full, or a hardware error occurred. Use the
Escape feature to display the space that remains on your current
drive.


-16367	Need to specify a specific record member or array element.

You cannot use the name of an array as an argument of a CALL command.
You cannot use the unqualified name of an array or record in an
expression or as the object of a breakpoint or tracepoint. In all these
cases, you must use a subscript in brackets to specify a particular
array element, or the full name of a member of a record.


-16368	Expression contains variables from different functions.

You cannot combine variables from different functions in the same
expression. If you need to know the value of such an expression, you
must use PRINT to evaluate the variables from each function separately.
Then enter these values as constants in the BREAK, LET, or PRINT
command in place of the names of the variables.


-16369	Cannot initialize application device device-name.

You must specify the name of another terminal that has the same termcap
or terminfo entries as the terminal from which you invoked the
Debugger. The second terminal must be logged in under your account
name.


-16370	No application device specified.

You must specify the name of another terminal that has the same termcap
or terminfo entries as the terminal from which you invoked the
Debugger. (However, it cannot be the name of the device from which you
invoked the Debugger.) Enter tty from the terminal that you want to use
as your application device. Its screen will display its terminal
pathname. Repeat the APPLICATION DEVICE command, specifying an
appropriate terminal device name.


-16371	Read file not specified.

You must specify the name of a .4db file in a READ command.


-16372	Variable or expression expected.

You must identify what you want the Debugger to display in a PRINT
command. Repeat the command, specifying the name of a variable, record
or array, or an expression.


-16373	Cannot print or make assignments before execution has started.

You cannot use a LET command to assign a value to a variable, or a DUMP
or PRINT command to display information about a variable or function
until after execution starts. The same restriction applies after
execution has terminated normally or after a CLEANUP command. Invoke
the RUN or CALL command to begin execution and then repeat the
command. (You might have to set a breakpoint or, in UNIX, press the
Interrupt key to prevent normal termination.)


-16374	Break command contains 'if' without having a condition specified.

An expression must follow the IF keyword in a BREAK command. The
breakpoint has no effect while the condition is false (zero). Repeat
the command without IF, or with IF and a condition.


-16375	Cannot view C-library function function-name.

The VIEW command cannot display the source code of C functions or
ESQL/C functions. To examine C source code, you must use the Escape
feature and use an operating-system command that displays the C source
file.


-16376	Break or trace name name does not begin with an alpha character.

The first character in the name of a breakpoint or of a tracepoint must
be a letter. The subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, or
underscores ( _ ). Single apostrophes ( ' ) or double-quote characters
( " ) must enclose the name. Repeat the command, specifying a valid
name enclosed in quotes.


-16377	Cannot retrieve values of global variables before execution begins.

A PRINT command cannot display the value of a global program variable
until after execution begins. Invoke the RUN or CALL command to begin
execution and then repeat the PRINT command. In this situation, you
can specify constants or the names of global variables as arguments of
CALL. (You might have to set a breakpoint or press the Interrupt key
to suspend the program before normal termination.)


-16378	A small positive integer is expected.

You cannot enter a TIMEDELAY command without an argument, or with a
negative number as the argument. Repeat the command, specifying zero or
a positive integer as the number of seconds delay in the Source window
or Command window.


-16381	Cannot set breakpoint or tracepoint - no current module.

You cannot set a breakpoint or tracepoint without referencing a module
or function unless a program module is in the Source window. You
probably ignored an error message that appeared when you were unable to
load a 4GL source file.


-16382	Command file filename is currently being processed.

You used a READ command, either nested in an initialization file or in
the input file of another READ command, that refers to one of the
following:

    *   To itself

    *   To a previous READ command input file

    *   To a .4db initialization file that has not yet completed
        execution

You cannot execute a READ command that might create an infinite loop.


-16383	Number of nested read commands limit exceeded.

You started a READ command that invoked another, which invoked another,
and so on for more than ten nested READ commands. You must simplify
your arrangement of .4db command files.


-16384	Line in .4db file exceeds maximum length.

You cannot have more than 256 characters in a single Debugger command
line. If you are using semicolon (;) command separators, break the line
into separate commands.

Avoid Debugger commands that have more characters in a single line than
your screen or list device can display. Use the backslash continuation
symbol to divide long command lines into shorter segments, or use
aliases.


-16385	Call to function function-name failed.

The logic in your 4GL or C language function might be defective or
might not support the argument list that you specified in a CALL
command. Use the VIEW command to examine the source code of a 4GL
function. Use the Escape feature to examine the source file of a C
function.


-16386	Search string exceeds maximum length.

The maximum length of a search pattern specification whose first
character is a quote (") is 80 characters. The maximum length is 50
after any other first character. Check if you unintentionally pressed a
Search command key (? or /). Repeat the Search command, but specify a
shorter pattern.


-16387	Program is not currently being executed.

A WHERE command cannot display your active functions until after
execution begins. Invoke the RUN or CALL command to begin execution,
and then repeat the command. (You might first have to set a breakpoint
to suspend execution before normal termination.) See the topic "Active
Functions and Variables" in the Debugger manual.


-16388	Cannot create Debugger window.

You are probably out of memory. Take whatever steps your operating
system permits to increase the amount of available memory.


-16389	File name exceeds maximum length.

A filename cannot exceed 80 characters. If the name exceeds this length
(if the message is not the result of some mistake in punctuation), you
must rename it before you use it with the Debugger.


-16390	Error occurred while reading file filename.

The Debugger encountered an error while it was trying to read a 4GL
source file. Look for other messages (from the operating system, for
example) that provide more details about the failure. Check that the
file exists and that you have read permission.


-16391	Internal error - attempt to highlight invalid line number.

Repeat the command. If the error recurs, note all circumstances,
and contact GBase Technical Support.


-16392	No database name specified.

The database command requires the name of a database as its argument.


-16393	Expression or variable contains invalid substring.

The Debugger cannot interpret a reference to a substring of a character
value. Two numbers in square brackets specify a substring, as in the
following expression:

charvalue[n1,n2]

The name charvalue must be the CHAR(n) data type; n1 specifies the
first character of the substring, and n2 specifies the last. This error
message appears when n1 is larger than n, the length of the character
value, or when n1 is greater than n2.


-16394	Cannot access the help messages.

The Debugger help messages are in the file fgldb.iem. The INSTALL
program copies this file into the msg directory to which the
GBASEDBTDIR environment variable points. Probably the file was damaged,
deleted, or read protected. Ask the system administrator to restore
your access to it.


-16395	Cannot compare BLOBs to any other value.

You asked the Debugger to compare a TEXT or BYTE variable in an
expression. You cannot use variables of these types for comparisons.
(However, you can refer to a substring of a TEXT variable.)


-16396	Cannot use BLOBs in this expression.

You asked the Debugger to use a TEXT or BYTE variable in an
expression. Variables of these types can only be displayed with PRINT
or DUMP statements, or assigned null values using the LET statement.


-16397	Can print only BLOB variables with program =.

The PROGRAM = clause of the PRINT statement is used to specify an
external program (for instance, a text editor) that can display the
contents of a BYTE or TEXT value. The clause is not relevant with any
other type of data.


-16398	Illegal BLOB file name. Null name not permitted.

The 4GL LOCATE statement has located the BYTE or TEXT variable in a
file. However, the filename for the variable is a null string. Because
the file does not exist, the Debugger cannot do anything with it.


-16399	No program name specified.

The PROGRAM = clause of the PRINT statement is used to specify an
external program (for instance, a text editor) that can display the
contents of a BYTE or TEXT value. In this command, the keyword was
specified, but no program name followed it.


-16400	Bad file name name.

The filename that is shown is not appropriate for its intended use. It
is too long, contains improper special characters, or is null. Enter an
appropriate filename.


-16401	No program loaded.

A program was unloaded with the command UNLOAD PROGRAM, but no program
was subsequently loaded with the command LOAD PROGRAM.


-19800	Role name already exists as a user or role.

You cannot create a role name identical to any user that is known to
the system or a user or role that is known to the database. Change the
name of the role.


-19801	Role name cannot be <reserved word>.

You cannot create a role name that is a reserved word. The reserved
words are connect, resource, dba, dbsecadm, select, update, delete, insert,
index, references, alter, execute, default, none, null, and public.
Change the name of the role.


-19802	Name cannot appear as both the role grantor and the role grantee.

A role cannot be granted to itself, either directly or indirectly.
Verify if the role grantor and grantee are the correct roles. Check for
roles already granted to the role that is being granted.

-19803	Only the DBA, or a user granted the role with the WITH GRANT OPTION can
grant, revoke, or drop a role.

Check your privileges and permissions. Only a DBA can grant, revoke, or drop a
default role to a user.

For example, a DBA can grant the default role to a user by running the following statement:
GRANT DEFAULT ROLE privilege TO user1;

A user who is granted a role with the WITH GRANT OPTION can
grant, revoke, or drop a role, optionally with the WITH GRANT OPTION to another user.

For example, a DBA can grant a privilege with the WITH GRANT OPTION to a user by running the following statement:
GRANT privilege TO user1 WITH GRANT OPTION;

Then that user can grant privileges to other users, for example, by running the following statements:
GRANT privilege TO user2 WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT privilege TO user3;

However, a non DBA user cannot grant the default role to a user. For example,
the following statement fails:
GRANT DEFAULT ROLE privilege TO usr2;

-19804	The role does not exist.

For a role to exist, the DBA must first use the CREATE ROLE statement
to create the role. For a list of roles, see the gbasedbt.sysusers
table.


-19805	No privilege to set to the role.

Check your privileges and permissions. A user or role must be granted a
role using the GRANT statement before the role can be set.


-19806	Cannot grant database privileges or default role to a role.

A role cannot be granted database-level privileges. Use the GRANT
statement to grant database-level privileges to the user or to PUBLIC.

A default role cannot be granted to a role. Use the GRANT DEFAULT ROLE
statement to grant default role to the user or to PUBLIC.

-19807	Cannot grant privileges to a role WITH GRANT option.

A user that is granted a role with the WITH GRANT option cannot in turn
grant the role to a user and include the WITH GRANT option. Use the
GRANT statement without the WITH GRANT option.


-19808	User name already exists as a rolename in the database.

A user cannot open a database as a role name that is the same as the
user name. Role names and user names must be unique in the database. If
you want to access the database, contact the DBA of the database. The
DBA can drop the role if necessary.


-19809	Invalid password to access the database.

Use the correct password.


-19810	Cannot set database password for a role.

You can set a database password only for a user.


-19811	DBpassword should not exceed 8 characters.

Choose a database password with a length that does not exceed eight
characters.


-19812	Illegal usage of replication shadow columns.

The specified operation cannot be performed on the replication shadow
columns.


-19813	Cannot add CRCOLS when table already has replication shadow columns.

The specified table was created with the WITH CRCOLS syntax and
therefore already has the replication shadow columns defined. You
cannot alter this table to add CRCOLS to it.


-19814	Cannot drop CRCOLS when table does not have replication shadow columns.

The specified table was not created with the WITH CRCOLS syntax, or it
has not been altered to include the CRCOLS. You cannot alter this table
and drop the CRCOLS because these columns do not exist on this table.


-19815	Cannot create a temp table with CRCOLS.

You cannot create a temporary table to include the replication shadow
columns.


-19816	Cannot perform this operation on a table defined for replication.

The specified operation cannot be performed on a table if Enterprise
Replication is defined on the table. If you want to perform the 
specified operation, you must delete all replicates defined on this table.

If the table is being captured using the Change Data Capture interface,
then you must use CDC API functions to stop data capture and disable 
full row logging on the table.


-19819	An ON-clause has an invalid table reference.

One of the ON clauses that you specified refers to a table that is not
within the scope of the join to which the ON clause belongs.

Check that the tables that you specify in the join criteria and join
filters of each ON clause are applicable to the join of which they are
a part.


-19820	GBase OUTER JOIN and ANSI JOIN in the same query block.

You cannot have GBase OUTER JOIN and ANSI JOIN in the same query
block. GBase OUTER JOIN and ANSI JOIN are two different mechanisms
and should not be combined in a single query. You can use only one of
these.


-19821	Cannot rename a table using a synonym.

You cannot rename a table using a synonym. Specify the <table-name> instead.

If you intend to rename the synonym, then drop the existing synonym and
create a new one.


-19822	Cannot alter or truncate a table or drop a table or view using a synonym.

You cannot perform an alter or drop on a table or view using a
synonym. Specify the <table-name> or <view-name> instead.

Or, to drop or alter the table or view using the synonym, first unset the environment variable USETABLENAME.

If you intend to drop the synonym, specify DROP SYNONYM <synonym-name> instead.


-19823	Cannot use EXECUTE PROCEDURE INTO with the INSTEAD OF trigger.

You cannot use EXECUTE PROCEDURE INTO with the INSTEAD OF
trigger.


-19824	Cannot use BEFORE or AFTER action with INSTEAD OF trigger.

You cannot use  BEFORE or AFTER with the INSTEAD OF trigger.  You
must use FOR EACH ROW with an INSTEAD OF trigger.


-19825	Cannot use WHEN clause if INSTEAD OF trigger is defined.

You cannot use the WHEN clause with INSTEAD OF triggers since you cannot
specify trigger restrictions for INSTEAD OF trigger statements.  The
trigger will always replace the specified action.


-19826	Cannot create INSTEAD OF trigger for a select event.

You can create an INSTEAD OF trigger for an insert, update, or delete
event, but not for a select event.


-19827	Cannot create an INSTEAD OF trigger on a table.

You can create an INSTEAD OF trigger on a view only and not on a base
table or synonym.


-19828	ORDER BY column or expression must be in SELECT list in this context.

You cannot omit the ORDER BY column or expression from the SELECT list in
the following situations:

*   The UNIQUE or DISTINCT operator is used.
*   The UNION, INTERSECT, or MINUS operator is used.
*   The query selects into a temporary table (SELECT ... INTO TEMP).
*   A distributed query references a server and requires ORDER
    BY columns to be in the SELECT list is used.
*   The query uses the GROUP BY clause with aggregate expressions. 
*   The expression uses an alias to a column substring.

Revise the SQL statement to follow these rules.


-19829	LVARCHAR column size is too big.

This statement specifies a width for a LVARCHAR column that exceeds 32,739. Use the TEXT,
BYTE or CLOB data type, which allow character strings of 2 gigabytes (TEXT
or BYTE)or 4 terabytes (CLOB)for a column.   

Otherwise, check the statement for typographical errors.


-19830	This operation is not allowed on a table where the type is raw.

An unsupported operation (for example, trying to create a constraint) was 
attempted on a RAW table.

You must alter the RAW table to a STANDARD table if you want to
perform an operation that RAW tables do not support. 


-19831	Referential constraints are not allowed on tables of type raw.

The CREATE TABLE statement contains constraints that are not allowed for RAW 
tables. Check your statement to make sure you do not define these kinds of 
constraints on RAW tables.
This error could also occur if you try to alter a STANDARD table to RAW but 
the table has referential constraints.

You must alter the RAW table to a STANDARD table if you want to use 
referential constraints.


-19832	Cannot alter table type in combination with other alter table
options.

You cannot alter the table type in combination with other ALTER 
TABLE options.

You must use separate statements to alter the table type with an ALTER
TABLE statement. It cannot be done in combination with other ALTER
TABLE options.


-19833	Table type raw not allowed together with access method.

You cannot associate a user-defined primary access method with a raw 
(nonlogging) table.

If you want to associate a user-defined primary access method with your
table, omit the keyword RAW from the CREATE TABLE statement. If you want
a raw table, omit the USING <access_method> clause from the CREATE TABLE
statement.


-19834	Error in unload due to invalid data : row number.

The column in a row that is being unloaded through an UNLOAD statement
has invalid characters for the current locale settings. The output file
that is specified in this UNLOAD statement has invalid data on the specified
line. 

Take corrective action before you can use the unload file for loading the data back into the database.
Delete or repair the row under consideration.


-19835	Cannot create an attached index with a collation different from
that of DB_LOCALE.

You cannot create an attached index when the collation set differs from
that of DB_LOCALE.

Use set collation to change the collation value to the DB_LOCALE value before
attempting to create an attached index.


-19836	Extent size is too large.  Maximum size of an extent is %sk.

The maximum size specified for a disk extent (either the EXTENT SIZE or
the NEXT SIZE clause) is 16 MB pages on 9.40 and the maximum size of a chunk
on 9.3x and lower.


-19837	Invalid PDQ priority value specified.

The value of PDQPRIORITY must range from -1 to 100.


-19838	Invalid partition was accessed by dirty reader.

The application had a dirty reader that tried to access an invalid
partition. The partition does not exist or was dropped when trying to
lock it.


-19839	Invalid OPTCOMPIND value specified.

The value of OPTCOMPIND must range from 0 to 2.


-19840	Invalid session environment variable.

The identifier cannot be set in a session using the SET ENVIRONMENT command. 

-19841	Error In Specifying Automatically (Server) Generated Keys.

Possible causes are: column does not exist in table, or column is not
a SERIAL or SERIAL8 or BIGSERIAL. Other causes are null String, null 
array, empty array or unknown constant. (Valid constants are 
NO_GENERATED_KEYS or RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS).

-19842	Invalid value specified for the USELASTCOMMITTED parameter.

You can set the USELASTCOMMITTED configuration parameter to one of the
following values : 'Dirty Read', 'Committed Read', 'All' or 'None'.

-19843	Invalid IFX_AUTO_REPREPARE value specified.

The value of IFX_AUTO_REPREPARE must be either 0, 'off', or 'OFF' (to disable 
the Auto Re-prepare feature) or else 1, 'on', or 'ON' (to enable this feature, so 
that the database server automatically re-prepares a prepared object or 
re-optimizes an SPL routine, after a table that the prepared object or SPL 
routine references has been renamed or after its schema has been modified.

-19844	Tables of type RAW are not allowed in a logged database on an HDR primary
server.

DML statements on RAW tables are not logged, and therefore not replicated to
the HDR secondary server. If you need RAW tables on an HDR primary server,
you must temporarily disable HDR. To use RAW tables on an HDR primary server:
1. Stop replication by shutting down the HDR secondary server.
2. Convert the HDR primary server into standard mode with the onmode -d standard command.
3. Create or alter the appropriate tables to type RAW.
4. Perform the required DML statements on the RAW tables.
5. Convert the RAW tables back to STANDARD tables.
6. Perform a level-0 archive. 
7. Convert the server to an HDR primary server with the onmode -d primary command.
8. Physically restore the secondary server from the level-0 archive.
9. Restart replication by running the onmode -d secondary command on the secondary server.

-19845	You cannot alter the logging mode of a table in a logged database on a primary server.

You cannot change a logged table in a logged database on a primary server 
into a RAW, nonlogging table because changes to that table would no longer
be replicated to secondary servers. You cannot change a RAW, nonlogging 
table to a logged table in a logged database on a primary server because 
the secondary servers would not be able to process replicated transactions 
for that table.

-19846	You cannot access a nonlogging table (%s) in a logged database on a secondary server.

Nonlogging tables are not replicated to secondary servers and are therefore
not available on secondary servers.

-19847	Incorrect session optimization environment variable.

The specified identifier cannot be set in a session using the SET OPTIMIZATION
ENVIRONMENT statement. 

-19848	Incorrect STAR_JOIN value specified.

The value for the STAR_JOIN optimization environment must be 'DISABLED',
'ENABLED', or 'FORCED'. Use the value 'DISABLED' to prevent star joins in this
session.  Use the value 'ENABLED' to allow star joins in this session. Use the
value 'FORCED' to favor star joins for all queries whenever possible in this
session.

-19850	Invalid OPT_SEEK_FACTOR value specified.

The value for OPT_SEEK_FACTOR must range from 0 to 25.

-19851	Invalid OPT_CPUCOST_FACTOR value specified.

The value for OPT_CPUCOST_FACTOR must range from 0 to 20.

-19990	Use of CRCOLS must be consistent across the table hierarchy.

If the parent table in a table hierarchy has been created with the
WITH CRCOLS option for replication shadow columns, then all
subtables must also be created with the WITH CRCOLS option.
Similarily, if the parent table in the table hierarchy has not been
created with the WITH CRCOLS option, then all subtables cannot
be created with the WITH CRCOLS option.

-19989	Enterprise Replication is not in active state

The specified operation cannot be performed on a table defined for
replication if Enterprise replication is not in active state.
If you want to perform the specified operation, you must start Enterprise
Replication.

-19991	Table is not in Enterprise Replication alter mode

The specified operation cannot be performed on a table defined for
replication if the table is not in Enterprise Replication alter mode.
If you want to perform the specified operation, you must put the table
in Enterprise Replication alter mode.

This error can also be returned when user attempts to modify primary key
constraint of a replicated table without setting alter mode manually 
using 'cdr alter --on DB1:OWNER1.TABLE1' command. Make sure to close the
current transaction before attempting manual alter mode.

-19992	Cannot perform insert/delete/update operations on a replicated table while the table is in alter mode

The specified operation cannot be performed on a table defined for
replication if the table is in Enterprise Replication alter mode.
If you want to perform the specified operation, you must unset the
Enterprise Replication alter mode.

-19993	Cannot modify a replicated column

The specified operation cannot be performed on a table defined for
replication. If you want to perform the specified operation,
you must remove the column from the replicate definition, alter the column
then add the column again to the replicate definition through
Enterprise Replication remastering process.

-19994	Cannot drop a replicated column while the column is part of replicate definition

The specified operation cannot be performed on a table defined for
replication. If you want to perform the specified operation,
you must remove the column from the replicate definition through
Enterprise Replication remastering process.

-19995	Enterprise Replication error encountered while setting alter mode. See the message log file to get the Enterprise Replication error code.

Enterprise Replication error encountered while performing the
specified operation. See the message log file to get the
Enterprise replication error code. If you want to perform the
specified operation, correct the Enterprise Replication problem
and reattempt the operation.

-19996	Enterprise Replication error encountered while unsetting alter mode. See message log file to get the Enterprise Replication error code

Enterprise Replication error encountered while performing the
specified operation. See the message log file to get the
Enterprise replication error code. Correct the problem and clear
the alter mode manually through cdr command line utility.

-19997	Cannot alter table type to STANDARD, failed to write a log record.

The table type could not be altered to STANDARD because the
system failed to write a log record for this operation.
Check the accompanying ISAM error code for more information.

-21000	Invalid byte in codeset conversion input.

The PICTURE clause contains an illegal keyword, as the error message
specifies. Check the syntax of the variable declaration for the PICTURE
clause and try again.


-22204	COBOL group USAGE clause contradiction (variable OF record).

The USAGE clause for a record component does not match the USAGE clause
of the record group to which it belongs. Usage clauses for the elements
of a record are inherited from the group record declaration. A mismatch
causes an error.


-22205	COBOL group SIGN clause contradiction (variable OF record).

The SIGN clause of the record component does not match the SIGN clause
of the record group to which it belongs. Sign clauses for the elements
of a record are inherited from the group record declaration. A mismatch
causes an error.


-22206	INTERNAL ERROR: Bad COBOL function call.

Check that the CALL syntax is correct and verify whether data is
corrupted before you call GBase Technical Support for assistance.


-22207	Host variables may only be 01-49 or 77 level.

ESQL/COBOL supports only level 01 through level 49 COBOL variables and
record types, plus COBOL variable level 77 if your COBOL compiler
supports it. Check the level number of the host variable to see if it
is valid.


-22208	Host variables may not be USAGE INDEX.

Change the USAGE clause for the host variable so that it is not USAGE
IS INDEX and try again. GBase ESQL/COBOL does not support USAGE
INDEX.


-22209	No hyphen allowed in SQL object identifier, cursor name, or
statement id.

You must change the name of the object identifier, cursor, or statement
ID so that it does not contain a hyphen.


-22210	Repeated data item variable-name is not expanded.

The ESQL/COBOL preprocessor does not expand the record that contains
repeated data items. Change the record and try again.


-22227	Invalid COBOL compiler compiler-name.

The compiler that is specified is not supported. Check the
GBase ESQL/COBOL Programmer's Manual for information on compilers

-22229	Host object variable-name not declared.

The specified host variable was accessed but was not declared. You must
declare the host variable in the declaration section and try again.


-22230	Identification error on host symbol variable-name.

The host variable has been declared more than once. Check for the
duplicate variable declaration and redeclare one of the variables.


-22231	Record nesting limit exceeded.

The maximum number of levels for valid record nesting is 100. Reduce
the number of nested records and try again.


-22232	variable-name is not a component of record-name.

The variable name is not part of the components of the record. Check
the record declaration and its components to verify that you have
correctly declared the variable with this name.


-22233	compiler-name does not allow array elements to be passed as parameters.

Unless you are using either the Ryan McFarland RM/COBOL 85 compiler or
the Micro Focus COBOL/2 compiler, you cannot pass array elements as
parameters. Use one of the specified compilers, or rewrite this section
of code that involves arrays.


-22234	Buffer provided by user is too small. Result will be truncated to fit
buffer.

The buffer that is used to store the result of the operation of the
function is too small to hold the entire result. As much of the result
as possible was copied, and extra characters were truncated. Increase
the buffer declaration so that it can hold larger strings.


-22245	Invalid BCD type (rvalhlvar).

valid categories for host variables: alphabetic, numeric, or
alphanumeric. GBase ESQL/COBOL does not support alphanumeric edited
or numeric edited items.


-22265	A sign clause was specified for an unsigned numeric type.

If you have a SIGN clause but did not specify "S," the compiler cannot
process the data type. Check whether the variable is signed or
unsigned and declare it accordingly.


-22266	Type not supported by ESQL/language-name for compiler-name.

The type that is specified for the variable is not supported for the
compiler name that is used. Check your compiler documentation for valid
type declarations.


-22268	P in the PICTURE clause not implemented.

Currently, GBase ESQL/COBOL does not support the declaration P
(decimal scaling position) in a PICTURE clause.


-22274	Host variables may not be USAGE POINTER.

Change the USAGE clause for the host variable so that the host variable
is not a pointer and try again.


-22275	INTERNAL ERROR: Temporary buffer length has been exceeded.

The string or buffer parameter to the function is longer than the
internal buffer. Change the string or buffer declaration so that the
string or buffer has a smaller maximum size.


-22276	Floating point variables are not allowed.

This compiler does not support floating-point numbers.


-22277	Invalid storage mode. Assuming byte-storage mode.

Micro-Focus COBOL/2 has either byte or word storage mode for USAGE
COMP/BINARY variables. Check the current storage mode. To specify byte
or word storage, set the GBASEDBTCOBSTORE environment variable, as the
GBase Guide to SQL: Reference discusses.


-22278	Cannot open COBOL 'whenever' file file-name.

The directory in which the COBOL temporary files are being created
(usually /tmp or whatever is specified when the DBTEMP environment
variable is set) is full. No room is available to open new files. Check
this directory and free some space. Since Version 5.01, the
GBase SE database server uses the DBTEMP environment variable, but
GBase Database Server and GBase Database Server do not.


-22279	Cannot open COBOL temp file file-name.

The directory in which the COBOL temporary files are being created
(usually /tmp or whatever is specified when the DBTEMP environment
variable is set) is full. No room is available to open new files. Check
this directory and free some space. Since Version 5.01, the
GBase SE database server uses the DBTEMP environment variable, but
GBase Database Server and GBase Database Server do not.


-22280	Line is too long.

The SQL string in the EXEC SQL statement is too long to fit in the
internal buffer. The maximum SQL string length should be less than
32,767.


-22281	FILLER variables can only be used as fields in a record.

In GBase ESQL/COBOL, the FILLER keyword must identify all filler
items. Filler variables can only be used as fields in a record and must
also have a PIC clause associated with them. Check the declaration of
the variable and change its name.


-22282	Invalid numeric data length.

The length and precision of the data is too large or otherwise
incorrect. The length cannot be greater than 18, and the precision
cannot be greater than the length.


-22283	Numeric value from database cannot be stored in COBOL data item.

In GBase ESQL/COBOL, a number of conditions can cause this error
message to appear. The value is too large, data cannot contain a
negative value, a signed value cannot be stored in an unsigned data
item, or a float overflow has occurred.


-22284	Incorrect levels of indirection on variable variable-name.

A pointer variable is used with the wrong number of level indirection.
Check the indirection levels in the ESQL statement.


-22285	Incorrect dimension on table variable variable-name.

An entry in a multidimensional array is illegally accessed. Indexes for
multidimensional arrays must be specified when used. For example,
suppose a host variable is declared in ESQL/COBOL as follows:

  01 VARA X(10) OCCURS 3 TIMES.

It will return an error if it is used in an SQL statement as follows
because you must specify the index into which you want to insert (that
is, VARA(1)):

INSERT INTO TAB VALUES ($VARA)


-22554	Field type field-type-name has been used out of context.

This error is generated when, for example, the field type TYPE is used
where COUNT is expected. Check the syntax and usage for
system-descriptor field names in the discussion of the ALLOCATE
DESCRIPTOR and GET DESCRIPTOR statements in the GBase
Guide to SQL: Syntax. For a discussion of the system-descriptor area,
see the manual for your embedded-language product.


-22555	The type of host-variable does not match the expected type for this
field.

This error is generated when a variable is expected to have a certain
type but does not. For example, an TYPE field accepts only integer
types when a value is assigned to it or retrieved from it. If the
variable type is not integer, an error is generated. Check the syntax
and usage for system descriptor field names in the discussion of the
ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR and GET DESCRIPTOR statements in the
GBase Guide to SQL: Syntax. For a discussion of the system
descriptor area, see the manual for your embedded-language product.


-22558	This feature is not supported in the GBase Database Server.

The GBase Database Server does not support this feature. Check the GBase ESQL/C Programmer's
Manual or GBase Guide to SQL Syntax for information on the DESCRIBE
statement functionality of this server version.


-22559	SQLUNKNOWN is invalid data type, need to be set valid data type.

If the database server cannot infer the type of parameter in an
expression, the DESCRIBE INPUT statement returns SQLUNKNOWN as
the data type.  Before statement execution, you must set a valid
SQL data type to replace SQLUNKNOWN.


-22600	Invalid SQL type type-name. Internal error.

For this GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error, check the data type
of the symbol. Type-name must be a valid SQL data type.


-22601	Whenever raise not supported by ESQL/FORTRAN.

You cannot specify RAISE in a WHENEVER statement. Delete the statement,
or substitute a valid option.


-22602	Whenever perform not supported by ESQL/FORTRAN.

You cannot specify PERFORM in a WHENEVER statement. Delete the
statement, or substitute a valid option.


-22617	STRUCTURE declaration not supported.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error.
The STRUCTURE statement is supported only with the Green Hills and Sun
versions of FORTRAN that include the VMS FORTRAN extensions.


-22618	RECORD statement not supported.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error.
The RECORD statement is supported only with the Green Hills and Sun
versions of FORTRAN that include the VMS FORTRAN extensions.


-22619	UNION declaration not supported.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error.
The UNION statement is supported only with Green Hills and Sun versions
of FORTRAN that include the VMS FORTRAN extensions.


-22620	Host object host variable not declared.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error. An
SQL statement contains a host variable that has not been declared. Host
variables are declared in the same way as other FORTRAN variables
except that the declaration must be contained in a declaration block
between a pair of EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION and EXEC SQL END
DECLARE SECTION statements. You cannot use the SQL data types to
declare host variables. You must specify a FORTRAN data type or one of
the GBase ESQL/FORTRAN data types when you declare a host variable.
The data type of the host variable should reflect the data type of the
database column to which it corresponds.


-22621	Out of Memory for symbol table.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error.
The preprocessor is unable to allocate more memory for the symbol
table. If possible, reduce the number of processes that are running at
the same time as the preprocessor or reduce the number of symbols that
your FORTRAN program defines.


-22622	Type type-name is unknown.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error.
The symbol is not a declared type. Declare type-name and try again.


-22623	Data type length must be greater than zero.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error.
The length that is specified for the data type is less than zero.
Assign a length to the data type and try again.


-22624	INTEGER type length must be 2 or 4.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error. A
FORTRAN host variable of type INTEGER must be declared as INTEGER*2 or
INTEGER*4. Correct the length of the INTEGER declaration and try
again.


-22625	REAL type length must be 4 or 8.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error. A
FORTRAN host variable of type REAL must be declared as REAL*4 or
REAL*8. Correct the length of the REAL declaration and try again.


-22626	Empty SQL statement.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error.
SQL statements and precompile instructions that are embedded in a
FORTRAN program must be preceded by the keywords EXEC SQL. No statement
terminator is required, except when you specify a multiple-statement
object in a PREPARE statement.


-22628	Record component component-name not declared.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error.
Examine the related structure declaration for this record. The
component-name element does not exist as it is typed within the
structure declaration.


-22635	INTERNAL ERROR. Temporary buffer length has been exceeded.

If this internal error recurs, note all circumstances and
contact GBase Technical Support.


-22645	Incorrect dimension on array variable.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error.
The symbol is not an array variable or the dimension is incorrect.


-22646	Incorrect levels of indirection.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN error message. An
incorrect index has been accessed in your array. Check the usage of
your array. See error message -33203 for a similar message in
GBase ESQL/C.


-22647	Use of non-SQL descriptors not supported by ESQL/FORTRAN.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error. In
ESQL/FORTRAN, only system descriptor areas that have been allocated
with the ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR statement can be used in a DESCRIBE
statement.


-22648	Line is too long.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error.
The SQL statement is too long (greater than 32 kilobytes). In standard
FORTRAN format, any nonblank character, except for zero, in column 6 is
a continuation symbol. In UNIX-style FORTRAN format, an ampersand in
column 1 is the continuation symbol. Shorten the SQL statement and try
again.


-22649	Unmatched END statement-name statement.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error. An
END STRUCTURE/UNION/MAP statement does not have a corresponding
STRUCTURE/UNION/MAP statement. Check that each END STRUCTURE/UNION/MAP
statement is paired with a corresponding STRUCTURE/UNION/MAP statement
and try again.


-22650	Missing END statement-name statement.

This message indicates an GBase ESQL/FORTRAN preprocessor error. A
STRUCTURE/UNION/MAP statement does not have a corresponding END
statement. Check that each STRUCTURE/UNION/MAP statement is paired with
a subsequent END statement and try again.


-23075	Unable to open the log file.

The ESQL processor cannot open the log file that is specified on the
command line. The log files are specified after the -log option. Check
that you have specified the log file correctly.


-23076	Incompatible file extension for '-e' option.

The filename that is specified after the -e option on the command line
for the ESQL processor has an incompatible file extension. Verify the
file extension and try again.


-23077	Missing target file name.

No output filename has been specified after the -o option on the
command line for the ESQL processor. Re-enter the command and
specify an output file.


-23078	Incompatible file extension for '-c' option.

The filename that is specified after the -c option on the command line
for the ESQL processor has an incompatible file extension. Verify the
file extension and try again.


-23079	Missing log filename.

No log filename has been specified after the -c option on the command
line for the ESQL processor. Enter the command again and specify a log
file.


-23080	Memory model conflict.

More than one memory model option has been specified on the command
line for the ESQL processor. Try again and specify only one memory
model option.


-23081	Compiler option conflict.

More than one compiler option has been specified on the command line
for the ESQL processor. Try again and specify only one compiler
option.


-23082	Missing list filename.

No list filename has been specified for the -f option on the command
line for the ESQL processor. Enter the command again and specify a
list file.


-23083	Application option conflict.

More than one application option has been specified on the command line
for the ESQL processor. Try again and specify only one application
option.


-23084	Cannot open ESQL response file 'file-name'.

The ESQL processor cannot open the ESQL response file that is specified
on the command line.


-23085	Unable to allocate memory.

The ESQL processor cannot allocate memory dynamically.


-23086	Unable to spawn the preprocessor.

The ESQL processor cannot spawn the ESQL preprocessor.


-23087	No source or object file.

You have not specified either a source file or an object file on the
command line for the ESQL processor. Re-enter the command and
specify either a source file or an object file.


-23088	Windows application or DLL needs a module definition file.

No module definition file has been specified on the command line for
the ESQL processor. Re-enter the command and specify a module
definition file.


-23091	Cannot open file 'file-name'.

The ESQL processor cannot open the specified file. Check that you have
specified the file correctly.


-23092	Unable to spawn the compiler.

The ESQL processor cannot spawn the compiler.


-23093	Unable to spawn the linker.

The ESQL processor cannot spawn the linker.


-23094	Unable to spawn the resource compiler.

The ESQL processor cannot spawn the resource compiler.


-23095	Unable to create the temporary file.

The ESQL processor cannot create the temporary file. Delete the
temporary files that start with "eq" in the specified directory.


-23096	Missing command line parameter file.

No command-line parameter file has been specified for the ESQL
processor. Try again and specify a command-line parameter file.


-23097	Too many parameters.

Too many parameters were specified on the command line for the
ESQL processor. Re-enter the command and specify fewer parameters.


-23098	No source file.

No source file has been specified on the command line for the ESQL
processor. Re-enter the command and specify a source file.


-23099	'file-name' has incompatible file format.

The specified list file or response file has an incompatible file
format for the ESQL processor.


-23100	Compilation errors.

The ESQL processor has terminated processing due to one or more
compilation errors.


-23101	Unable to load locale categories.

An invalid locale name was supplied for the locale initialization.
The environment variable specifying the locale category has a wrong
value. 

Check the value of the corresponding environment variable,
CLIENT_LOCALE or DB_LOCALE. If this error was encountered when using 
the "SET COLLATION" statement, check that the value passed to the 
statement is a valid locale. If this error was encountered when using
the "SET NO COLLATION" statement, check that the session's default 
locale file is still available. Also check if GBASEDBTDIR points to
a valid directory where GBase products are installed.  

If a client application receives this error when it requests a database
server connection, check that the client and database locales are
compatible. They are compatible if a valid locale exists on the server
computer with the name lg_tr.codeset@mod, where lg_tr (language and
territory) and mod (locale modifier) are from the CLIENT_LOCALE and
codeset is from the database locale (from the DB_LOCALE, if it is set,
or as stored in the database).



-23102	Memory allocation failed during locale processing.

The program cannot allocate enough memory for the internal code-set
conversion buffer or control table. Only a client process returns this
error. Rerun the program after you free some memory.


-23103	Code-set conversion function failed due to an illegal sequence or
invalid value.

Illegal or invalid characters occur in the character string. The
program could not execute the code-set conversion on the characters
that this string contains. Reexamine the input string for illegal or
invalid characters and reexecute the program.


-23104	Error opening required code-set conversion object file.

No object code-set conversion (definition) file exists for the two
given code sets. The environment variables DB_LOCALE or CLIENT_LOCALE
might have been set to the wrong value, which caused an error condition
to be generated. The files might also be missing, or the information
that they contain might be garbled. Check the value of the environment
variable CLIENT_LOCALE or DB_LOCALE. The object conversion files
usually have the .cvo extension.

When accessing via drda protocol, this error may also mean that the client 
application is trying to bind a value which is in a different encoding than 
database locale.  Set environment variable GL_USEGLU=1 prior to bringing
up the server to initialize the appropriate converters required to handle
the codeset conversions. (for example, when using setCharacterStream() 
interface to bind the LOB data through JCC, the input data may come with 
double byte encoding and may mismatch with DB_LOCALE)


-23105	The current database engine does not support code-set conversion.

The code-set conversion in the database server is not yet implemented.
Check the value of the CLIENT_LOCALE, SERVER_LOCALE, or DB_LOCALE
environment variable.


-23106	Invalid argument for the code-set conversion initializing function.

An invalid argument has been passed to the internal code-set conversion
initializing function. Check the logic of your application program.


-23107	DBLANG and CLIENT_LOCALE environment variables are incompatible.

DBLANG is the environment variable that points to the location where
the message files are stored. Usually, the value of DBLANG corresponds
with that of CLIENT_LOCALE. The value of DBLANG could be en_US.8859-1
or a value set according to X/Open standards for locale definitions.
The locale is a set of files that defines the characteristics of a
particular language (for example, French or Japanese), a particular
territory (for example, France or Japan) and a particular code set (for
example, MS Windows Code Page 1251 or ISO 8859-1). An example of a
locale name for the French language in Canada that is encoded using ISO
8859-1 would be fr_CA.8859-1, and a locale name for the Japanese
language that is encoded using EUC (Extended Unix Code) would be
ja_JP.ujis.

Reexamine the value of the environment variables, DBLANG and
CLIENT_LOCALE.


-23108	An error occurred during locale structure creation.

The locale initialization failed. The program cannot allocate enough
memory for the internal locale table. The memory might be exhausted due
to the execution of too many processes. Rerun the program after you
free some memory.


-23109	Invalid locale specification.

A locale, with which all locale-sensitive processing occurs, is
established on both the client and database server side. This
processing locale is set with information from environment variables
and from data that is stored in the database. An internal function
could not compose the long form of the NLS locale in its internal
array. Not all the categories (LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MONETARY,
LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME) could be composed. Check the value of the
environment variables CLIENT_LOCALE and DB_LOCALE. Also check the value
of GBASEDBTDIR.


-23110	An error occurred during environment variable processing.

The GLS initialization function encountered an error while it was
processing the list of environment variables. The environment variables
are read onto a stack for further use by various internal functions.
The environment variable values are read either from resource files or
directly as shell environment variables. While the GLS initialization
function was processing these values, it might have been encountered
the following exceptions: end-of-file, not-found, illegal-value,
unknown-value, null-value, max-path exceeded. Any of these exceptions
can cause this error. Check the semantics and contents of the defined
environment variables.


-23111	Internal error. Illegal argument for locale initialization.

An internal function used an illegal argument while it was initializing
the GLS structures. The arguments can only be one of the following:
FE_PROC, BE_PROC, or SESS_PROC. If the error recurs, see your
Administrator's Guide or Reference to acquire additional diagnostics and
contact GBase Technical Support with the diagnostic information.


-23112	Place holder for invalid GCV argument.

During code-set conversion, if both the input buffer and the output
buffer are of NULL length, code-set conversion does not proceed, and
the conversion process terminates after this error is returned. Check
the logic of your application program.


-23113	Place holder for unknown GCV error.

During code-set conversion, if the input buffer is of NULL length, this
error is returned. Code-set conversion requires an input buffer and an
output buffer. The input buffer is the string passed to the database
server from the application program as a result of an insert or update.
Check the logic of your application program.


-23114	Place holder for GCV truncation.

During code-set conversion of tuple data, if the output buffer is not
large enough to hold the result of a code-set conversion, and the
resultant string could not be truncated into the available buffer
successfully, this error is returned. This error occurs in the SQL
interface layer between the application program and the database
server. Increase the size of the host variable that will hold the
possibly expanded string that is returned after code-set conversion
from a SELECT or FETCH statement.


-23115	Code sets of the locale categories are not the same.

On the client side or database server side, the locale is established
with the following precedence of announcement mechanisms, the
CLIENT_LOCALE, LANG, LC_*, and the English locale, en_US.8859-1. Given
this precedence, the six categories of the processing locale are set in
the following way: COLLATION, CTYPE, TIME, MONEY, NUMBER, MESSAGES.

The GLS initialization function returned this error because an invalid
locale was specified. The locale specifier is usually the environment
variables. Check the value of GBASEDBTDIR and CLIENT_LOCALE.
GBASEDBTDIR should point to a valid directory where the GBase
products are installed. This directory should also contain
the /gls directory where the locale and code-set files reside.


-23190	Multibyte database name is not allowed in this system.

The SE server does not allow a multibyte database name in the specified
environment. Change the database name.


-23194	Code-set conversion restore failed.

The database server has failed to restore the code-set conversion table
to the previous state. Not enough memory is available to hold table
information. Reexecute the program after you free some memory.


-23195	Reset locale failed. Connection refused.

The database server failed to change the database processing locale
to en_US.8859-1. The server refused the connection. Not enough
memory is available in the server for the new locale table. Reexecute
the program after you free some memory.


-23196	Unknown locale in selected database.

The locale information that is stored in the system catalog systables
of the selected database does not match the value that the DB_LOCALE
environment variable specifies. Check the value of DB_LOCALE. If it is
correct, drop the database and re-create it with the correct value of
DB_LOCALE.


-23197	Database locale information mismatch.

The locale information GL_CTYPE or GL_COLLATE in the system catalog of
the specified database does not match the locale information in the
specified environment variable DB_LOCALE. Check the value of
DB_LOCALE.


-23198	GL-COLLATE information is missing from the system catalogs.

No locale information GL_COLLATE exists in the system catalog. The
system catalog systables might be missing or corrupted. Drop the
database and re-create it with the correct value for DB_LOCALE.


-23199	GL_CTYPE information is missing from the system catalogs.

No locale information GL_CTYPE exists in the system catalog. The system
catalog systables might be missing or corrupted. Drop the database and
re-create it with the correct value for DB_LOCALE.

different pathname for it or specify an offset beyond the end of the
existing chunk within the same pathname.


-23508	CM error: Chunk table overflow.

An attempt to create a new chunk failed because the maximum allowed
number of chunks is already in use.

Drop one or more obsolete chunks and resubmit the request.


-23510	CM error: Cannot drop first chunk.

An attempt to delete the first chunk in a dbspace failed because
deleting the first chunk in a dbspace is an invalid operation.

Check which chunk should be dropped. To drop the dbspace after the
chunk, simply drop the dbspace.


-23511	CM error: No such dbslice.

A request for information about a dbslice, to delete a dbslice, to
identify a dbslice as the basis for a logslice, or to read dbslice
information during startup failed because the referenced dbslice
is not in use.

-23709	File specified as a FILE type but is not: (cosvr, file)=(%s).

The file named in the external table was called a "FILE" file type,
but it is not. If this file is a UNIX named pipe, change the file type in
the external table to "PIPE". When the file type is declared as FILE,
the server is expecting a disk file.


-23710	File specified as a PIPE type but is not: (cosvr, file)=(%s).

The file named in the external table was called a "PIPE" file type,
but it is not. If this file is a disk file, change the file type in
the external table to "FILE". When the file type is declared as PIPE,

in the delimited load file.

Check to see that the file has record delimiters (normally new-line
characters) and that the external table has defined the correct record
delimiter.


-23738	PLOAD (unload) cannot undo partial write to filename when detecting
disk full.

An error occurred when the database server tried to continue after running 
out of space for one data file. When the database server detects the disk-full
condition, it writes to the data file a partial record, which cannot be
truncated.

Look for operating-system messages that might give more information.


-23739	Cannot open PLOAD log file.

An error occurred when the database server tried to open the log file
for a load or unload operation.

This situation occurs when one of the directories in the specified
log-file name does not exist, or the directory is write protected.

Check that the directory path is valid and that group gbasedbt can
write to the directory.


-23740	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE: Too many keyword keywords in USING clause.

The CREATE EXTERNAL table statement (or SELECT...INTO EXTERNAL
statement) contains more than one occurrence of a keyword expected in
the USING clause.

Review the statement. If you meant to use another keyword, correct the
statement before you reissue it.


-23741	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE: Invalid value for keyword.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement (or SELECT...INTO EXTERNAL
statement) contains an invalid value for one of the USING clause
keywords.

Review the statement to see if the value of the keyword is misspelled.
For the MAXERRORS keyword, make sure the value is a valid number.


-23742	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE: Invalid DATAFILES entry.

A DATAFILES entry does not have the correct format. The format for an
entry is filetype:coserver-info:rooted-path-name.

Check that the file type is a valid type (DISK or PIPE), that the
second item names a cogroup or a coserver number, and that the last
item names a file that can be accessed by the coserver that manages
it.


-23743	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE: Missing DATAFILE entries.

The DATAFILES entry in the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement (or
SELECT...INTO EXTERNAL statement) is missing. Add a DATAFILES entry
and reissue the statement.


-23744	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE: Cannot use SAMEAS for FIXED format tables.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement does not allow SAMEAS for FIXED
format tables. The column entries must also define an external type to
describe how to access (or write) the data in the fixed file.

Revise the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement to enumerate the column
information and reissue the statement.


-23745	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE: Internal column types must be defined
column-name.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement requires a column type for each
column enumerated in the statement.

Revise the statement. Add the appropriate column type and then reissue
the statement.


-23746	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE: Invalid external column type column-name.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement contains an invalid external column
type.

Make sure the external-column types are valid: CHAR, PACKED, ZONED, or
BINARY. CHAR data must be enclosed in quotes.


-23747	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE: FIXED or DELIMITED columns must be external
chars column-name.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement contains an external column type
that is invalid. If the table describes a FIXED format file, the valid
external- column types are CHAR, PACKED, ZONED, and BINARY. CHAR data
must be enclosed in quotes.

If the table describes a DELIMITED format file and includes
external-column types, then the type must be CHAR. A table that
describes DELIMITED format files does not need to include
external-column-type information.


-23748	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE: Missing external-column-type column-name.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement is missing the external-column-
type information. This information is required for tables that describe
FIXED format files.

Add the column-type information and resubmit the statement.


-23749	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE: Only FIXED format columns can declare null
column-name.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE table statement has found a column defining a
null string with the NULL "null-string" syntax that is invalid. Only
tables that describe FIXED format files can have a null value defined
with the NULL keyword.

Rework the statement and resubmit it.


-23750	Invalid file type in DATAFILES string datafile entry.

An error occurred when the database server tried to expand the DATAFILES
entries in an INSERT or SELECT statement for an external table. The
external table has a DATAFILES entry with an illegal file type. Only
DISK and PIPE file types are allowed for external tables.

Examine the external-table entry, drop the external table, and reissue
a corrected CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement to correct this error.


-23751	Could not replace n macro in filename entry.

-23755	Missing delimiter at end of coserver item coserver-number, errno,
filename.

An error occurred when the database server tried to expand the
DATAFILES entries in an INSERT or SELECT statement for an external
table. The external table has a DATAFILES entry that does not have the
expected colon separators between entries. The format for an entry is
filetype:coserver-info:rooted-path-name.

Examine the external tables entry, drop the external table, and reissue
a corrected CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement.


-23756	Unknown coserver coserver number.

An error occurred when the database server tried to expand the DATAFILES
entries in an INSERT or SELECT statement for an external table. The
external table has a DATAFILES entry that does not have a known coserver
number.

Examine the external tables entry, drop the external table, and reissue
a corrected create external statement.


-23757	Unknown cogroup cogroup name.

An error occurred when the database server tried to expand the DATAFILES
entries in an INSERT or SELECT statement for an external table. The
external table has a DATAFILES entry that does not have a known cogroup 
name.

all the file macros). Check to see that the full path name of the
file is less than 257 characters long.


-23761	Cannot select from multiple external tables.

Only one external table can be used in a select query. For unions/intersects
/minuses, each union/intersect/minus contributor can have one external table. 
External tables are allowed as participants in joins and subqueries along with
other database tables.

Check that the FROM clause contains only one external table.


-23762	Null string longer than external column length or of bad format
string.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement has a column with invalid NULL
"null-string" syntax. The NULL string for this column is longer than
the external column length declared or is not a recognized format for
the external type. If "null-string" is used to declare a NULL on a PACKED
or ZONED decimal, it must conform to the formats allowed. BINARY external
types must contain valid numeric values.

Check the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement to make sure that the NULL
"null-string" length agrees with the size and format defined for the 
external column type.


-23763	Cannot use a FOR UPDATE or FIRST n clause with a SELECT into an
external table.

The SELECT statement contains a FOR UPDATE or FIRST n clause. When
the database server unloads to an external table, these clauses are not
allowed.

Check the SELECT statement or when the SELECT cursor was defined, and
make sure you do not include either of these clauses.


-23764	Insert into an external table must provide values for all columns in
the table.

The INSERT statement does not list all the columns that the external
table defines. When the database server unloads to an external table, all
columns must have values described by the SELECT list.

Check the INSERT statement to make sure that all columns are included
in the INSERT clause and that every column has a value supplied by the
SELECT list.


-23765	Cannot use a FOR UPDATE clause with a select from external table.

The SELECT statement contains a FOR UPDATE clause. When the database server
selects from an external table, this clause is not allowed.

Check the SELECT statement or the cursor declared to make sure you do
not include this clause.


-23766	Illegal use of an external table tablename in query.

This statement describes an illegal operation on an external table. The
types of operations allowed for external tables are CREATE TABLE,
SELECT, SELECT INTO, INSERT, DROP TABLE, GRANT, REVOKE, CREATE SYNONYM,
RENAME COLUMN, and RENAME TABLE.


-23767	Column too long for fixed field.  (Val = value, Col = colno,
Len = converted length, Max = maxLen).

When the database server tries to convert the column to FIXED file format, the
size of the converted value was longer than the maximum size defined
for the fixed- size field.

Check that the external table description defines enough space in the
external column type to hold the data selected after conversion.


-23768	External table must be fixed format for external column type
column-name.

An external column type of PACKED, ZONED or BINARY was found for an
external table that is not defined as a FIXED-format file.

Only FIXED-format files can define external-column types that are not
CHAR.


-23769	Unknown external column type column-name.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement contains an external-column type
that was not recognized. Valid external-column types are CHAR, PACKED,
ZONED, and BINARY. CHAR values must be in quotes.

Check the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement to make sure that the
external-column types are valid.


-23770	Only check constraints can be defined for external tables.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement contains one or more types of
constraint that are not allowed.

Check the statement for primary-key, referential, or unique constraints
on a column or for the table.


-23771	Internal type must be a numeric type column-name.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement contains external-column types that
do not agree with the internal-column type. Whenever the external-
column type is PACKED, ZONED or BINARY, the internal type must be a
numeric type such as INTEGER, SMALLINT, FLOAT, or DECIMAL.

Check the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement to make sure any external-
column types agree with the internal-column type.


-23772	Internal type must be a small integer or integer column-name.

The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement contains external-column types that
do not agree with the internal-column type. Whenever the external-
column type is BINARY, the internal type must be SMALL INTEGER or
INTEGER.

Check the CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statement to make sure any external-
column types agree with the internal-column type.


-23773	Reached max error during load coserver-number, errno, filename.

When the database server tried to load the data from the external table,
one of the coservers reached the MAXERRORS limit defined for the 
external table.


-23774	Create external table for table_name failed.

The CREATE EXTERNAL table encountered an error trying to create
the catalog entry for the table. Check the accompanying ISAM error 
code for further information about the failure.


-23800	An internal error has occurred in the XTM facility.

Note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support
regarding this internal error.


-23801	A memory allocation error has occurred in the XTM facility.

The database server needed to allocate data-space memory to process the
query, but none was available. This situation might reflect a hardware
limit, an operating-system configuration limit, or a temporary shortage
of space.


-23802	A request to idle an XTM participant has failed. Transactions are in
an inconsistent state.

A nonrecoverable internal error occurred within the transaction-
management system.

Note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-23803	An XMF send has failed within the XTM facility.

An internal error occurred within the transaction-management system.

Note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-23804	An XMF receive has failed within the XTM facility.

An internal error occurred within the transaction-management system.

Note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-23805	An unknown transaction ID was encountered in the XTM transaction
management system.

A nonrecoverable error occurred within the transaction-management
system.

Note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support
regarding this internal error.


-23807	The backup information for the XTM coordinator is corrupted.

A nonrecoverable error occurred within the transaction-management
system.

Note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support
regarding this internal error.


-23808	The creation of the XMF port for the XTM facility failed.

A nonrecoverable error occurred within the transaction-management
system.

Note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support
regarding this internal error.


-23850	Table type specified twice.

The CREATE TABLE statement contains more than one table type.

Check the statement to make sure that only one table type is defined.


-23851	This operation is not allowed on a table where the type is raw or
scratch.

An illegal operation (for example, trying to create an index) has been
attempted on a RAW or SCRATCH table.

You might want to alter the table type to a type that supports the
operation.


-23852	This operation is not allowed on a table where the type is static.

The statement issued tries to modify data in the table with an UPDATE,
INSERT, or DELETE statement. Data modification is not allowed on tables
of type STATIC. You might want to alter the type to one of the other
types that support data modification.


-23853	Unable to change the type of table tablename.

An error occurred when the database server tried to alter the type of the
table. Possibly you tried to alter the table type to RAW when indexes
are defined on the table, or you tried to change a table to STANDARD
when an archive has not been made.


-23854	Indexes and constraints are not allowed on tables if type is raw
or scratch.

This error could occur if you try to alter a STANDARD table to
RAW or SCRATCH but the table has indexes or referential constraints.
The CREATE TABLE statement contains indexes or constraints that are not
allowed for RAW or SCRATCH tables. Check your statement to make sure
you do not define these kinds of constraints or indexes on RAW or
SCRATCH tables. 

You must alter the RAW or SCRATCH table to a STANDARD
table if you want to use indexes and referential constraints.


-23855	Express mode loads are not permitted for this type of table.

An error occurred when the database server tried to execute an
express-mode load on an external table created with the EXPRESS
keyword.  This error can happen if the external table contains
blob columns or if the internal table requires logging inserts.
An internal table will require logging inserts whenever it has
the type STANDARD or has referential or unique constraints.

If the internal table requires logged inserts or the external table
contains blob columns, re-create the external table description
without the EXPRESS keyword.


-23857	This operation is not allowed on tables where the type is raw or static.

An illegal operation (for example, trying to do an alter table for
anything but table type) has been attempted on a RAW or STATIC table.

You might want to alter the table type to a type that supports the
operation. Do the operation that failed. Alter the table back to the
original type.


-23858	This operation is not allowed on a temporary table (<tabname>).

The specified table is a temporary table, and the attempted operation
is not allowed on a temporary table.

Specify a table that is not temporary and retry the operation.


-23859	This operation is not allowed on a violations/diagnostics
table (<tabname>).

The specified table is a violations or diagnostics table, and the
attempted operation is not allowed on such a table.

Specify a table that is not a violations or diagnostics table and retry
the operation.


-23860	This operation is not allowed on a duplicated table (<tabname>).

The specified table has been duplicated with the CREATE DUPLICATE
statement. The attempted operation is not allowed on a duplicated
table.

To perform the operation, first issue a DROP DUPLICATE statement
for <tabname>. After you perform the operation against the
nonduplicated table, consider whether you need to issue another
CREATE DUPLICATE command to duplicate the table again.


-23900	freeshdic FAILED: non-exclusive access dic <tablename> ref
<referenceCnt> lk <lockCnt> possible memory loss.

An error occurred when the database server tried to free memory for a
shared dictionary entry. If this internal error recurs, note all
circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-23901	Index name (index_name) with leading byte 0x20 not allowed.

In some situations, such as when a constraint is defined, the database 
server creates indexes internally. These indexes, by convention, always
have a leading ASCII blank (hex 20) as the first byte of their name. To 
avoid a conflict, user-created indexes cannot have an ASCII blank (hex 20)
as the first byte of their name. This rule is enforced regardless of the
locale. This rule is also enforced regardless of the use of the
DELIMIDENT environment variable.


-23901	Alter table is not allowed in a multi-statement transaction.

Try separating the ALTER TABLE statement into its own single-statement
transaction.


-23902	Operation is not supported in SMI database (%s).

UPDATE STATISTICS cannot be run on the sysmaster database. Check
your statement and make sure that the table on which you are running update
statistics is not in the sysmaster database.


-23903	The EXPLAIN output file name must be a NON-NULL CHAR or VARCHAR.

The name given to the EXPLAIN output file is null. Provide a name for
the EXPLAIN output file.


-23904	Attached table (tabname) has an incompatible hash column
specification.

The hash column specification of the table named in the error message 
is not compatible with that of the surviving table or a prior table 
in the attach list. All tables involved in the attach that have hash-column
specifications must have identical hash-column specifications.


-23905	Attached table (tabname) has an incompatible table type.

The table type (standard, raw, etc.) of each attached table must 
match that of the surviving table.


-23906	Dbslice lookup failed.

This code indicates that the dbslice specified in the operation
(for example, in the IN clause of the CREATE TABLE ... FRAGMENT BY
statement) has not been defined. Make sure that the specified
dbslice is indeed the name of an existing dbslice and not of a dbspace.
You can run the onstat utility with the -d option to see the names of
defined dbspaces. Names ending with .number are dbspaces that belong
to a dbslice (for example, dbsl.1 and dbsl.2 are two spaces in the
dbslice dbsl).


-23907	Column columnname for hash fragmentation doesn't exist.

The column name specified for hash or hybrid fragmentation was not found
in the table.


-23908	Alter Fragment option not supported for hash fragmentation.

The surviving table has hash fragmentation and an ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE 
option other than INIT or ATTACH was specified. INIT and ATTACH are the 
only supported options for hash-fragmented tables.


-23910	Result types from case expression must be compatible.

The case expression has a result type that is incompatible with other
result types in this expression. Only one type can be returned in
a case expression. Review the data types in your case expression
and make sure that only compatible result types are returned.


-23911	Cannot update a row twice in a joined-row update.

If you do an update join, the join condition and any filters
must be sufficiently strict so that no row of the update target table
is produced more than once for updating. The error occurred because
the same row came around twice. The query was terminated abnormally.

Either clean the data source or sources, or make the query more restrictive
so that no target table row is produced more than once for updating.


-23913	SAMPLE/LOCAL specifiers apply to tables. <identifier> is not a table.

The select statement includes a SAMPLE or LOCAL keyword, but the
table_name specified in the FROM clause is not a database table.
Check to see that the tables specified by the SAMPLE or LOCAL
keyword in the FROM clause are not VIEWS or EXTERNAL TABLES.


-23914	Operation not supported on secondary coservers.

An operation that can only be performed on the MDM Primary coserver
was attempted from another coserver. This is an internal error.
Note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-23915	Alter Fragment option not supported for hybrid fragmentation.

The surviving table has hybrid fragmentation and an ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE
option other than INIT, ATTACH, or DETACH was specified. INIT, ATTACH,
and DETACH are the only supported options for hybrid-fragmented tables.


-23916	Attached table (tabname) has an incompatible fragmentation
scheme.

The fragmentation scheme of the table named in the error message is not a 
kind that can be attached to the surviving table in the ALTER FRAGMENT ON
TABLE command.


-23917	Unable to lock row for hold cursor.

When a lock is required for a row in a hold cursor, it must be a
special type of lock so that it is not released prematurely. This error
indicates that the hold cursor lock attribute could not be acquired.

The accompanying ISAM error code might indicate the reason.


-23918	Cannot create detached cluster index.

Fragmentation scheme cannot be specified when creating cluster index.


-23920	Could not create bitmap index due to outstanding in-place alter.

A create index using bitmap statement was specified on a table that has
outstanding in-place alters. The in-place alter must complete before
such an index can be created. A dummy update of the entire table will
cause the in-place alter to complete.

An example of a dummy update is an update that changes all the
rows in the table and specifies that a column be set to itself.


-23921	Cannot alter table type in combination with other alter table
options.

You must use separate statements to alter the table type with an ALTER
TABLE statement. It cannot be done in combination with other ALTER
TABLE options.


-23922	Serial column usage incompatible with fragmentation scheme.

A table can be fragmented on a serial column only if the table is fragmented
by hash and the serial column is the only column in the key. Tables fragmented
by expression or hybrid that use serial columns in the fragmentation are not
valid. Neither are hash-fragmented tables that have any columns in addition
to the serial column used for fragmentation.


-23923	HAVING clause should be accompanied by a GROUP clause or with
aggregates on all columns in the SELECT clause.

The HAVING clause in a query should be accompanied by a GROUP BY clause or
by a SELECT clause containing only AGGREGATES on columns or
column-expressions. The HAVING clause is used to apply filter expressions on
a "grouped" result. A grouped result is obtained either by using a GROUP BY
clause or by using only AGGREGATES in the SELECT clause. In the latter case,
the result involves only one group and the result contains only one
aggregated row.


-23925	Second arg of dbinfo(dbspace/coserverid) cannot specify a view.

The dbinfo() function call has either 'dbspace' or 'coserverid' as the first
argument and the second argument specifies a column name. Column names
qualified by view names are not supported.

Check to see that the second argument specifies a column name qualified by a
table name.


-23926	Second arg of dbinfo(dbspace/coserverid) must specify a column.

The dbinfo() function has either 'dbspace' or 'coserverid' as the first
argument and the second argument does not specify a column.

Check to see that the second argument specifies a column name qualified by a
table name.


-23927	Third arg of dbinfo(dbspace/coserverid) must be string
'currentrow'.

The dbinfo() function was called with either 'dbspace' or 'coserverid' as
the first argument followed by a column name as the second argument and an
invalid third argument.

Check to see that the third argument corresponds to the quoted string
constant 'currentrow'.


-23929	Cannot set memory resident status for a view.

The memory residency status for views cannot be changed.


-23930	GK-index creation syntax error:  (message)

The database server cannot create a general-key index for the reason 
stated in the error message. Correct the CREATE GK INDEX statement.


-23931	GK-index creation: FROM clause must contain LOCAL, STATIC BASE tables
only.

The database server cannot create a general-key index because one of the
tables in the FROM clause is either a remote table, a non-static table,
or a view. Correct the CREATE GK INDEX statement.


-23932	GK-index creation:  indexed table missing in the SELECT statement.

The FROM clause must include the table on which the index is defined. The 
indexed table in the FROM clause cannot be aliased. Rewrite the FROM clause 
of the statement.


-23933	GAM sanity error: (message)

If this internal error recurs, note all circumstances and contact 
GBase Technical Support. Be sure to record the information 
given in the error message.


-23934	GAM internal error: (error_number)

If this internal error recurs, note all circumstances and contact  
GBase Technical Support. Be sure to record the information 
given in the error message.


-23935	GAM: HCNF not supported yet.

This error indicates that the SELECT clause cannot be transformed into the
Hybrid Conjunctive Normal Form (HCNF), an internal query representation 
that checks whether the index can be applied to the current query.


-23936	There are GK-indexes depending on a table in the statement.

This statement cannot be executed because general-key indexes exist
that depend on a table or tables involved in the statement. Drop the
general-key index that depends on the table.

To determine which GK indexes need to be dropped to correct this error,
run the following query on the system catalog table:

SELECT sysindexes.idxname, sysindexes.owner
        FROM systables, sysindexes, sysnewdepend
        WHERE systables.tabname = "<table_name>"
        AND systables.tabid = sysnewdepend.destid1
        AND sysnewdepend.srcid2 = sysindexes.tabid
        AND sysnewdepend.srcid1 = sysindexes.idxname

When a particular column of the GK index is involved (for example, in the
case of a RENAME COLUMN statement), run the following query to determine
which GK indexes need to be dropped:

SELECT sysindexes.idxname, sysindexes.owner
        FROM sysindexes, systables, syscolumns, sysnewdepend
        WHERE systables.tabname = "<table_name>"
        AND syscolumns.colname = "<column_name>"
        AND systables.tabid = sysnewdepend.destid1
        AND syscolumns.colno = sysnewdepend.destid2
        AND sysnewdepend.srcid2 = sysindexes.tabid
        AND sysnewdepend.srcid1 = sysindexes.idxname

 
-23937	GK-index creation: table (table_name) isn't join-on-key to
the indexed table.
 
The error message shows the name (table_name) of the table that is not 
correctly joined in the WHERE clause of the statement. Change the WHERE 
clause to include an equality test.

-23979	XBAR error: Invalid coserver id.

An invalid coserver ID was specified for backup or restore.

Make sure that the coservers specified on the command line for backup
or restore are valid. Check the server message log and client message
log for more information.


-23980	XBAR error: Duplicate coserver id.

A duplicate coserver ID was specified for backup or restore.

Make sure that the coservers specified on the command line for backup
or restore do not contain duplicates. Check server message log and
client message log for more information.


-23981	XBAR error: Allocate transport buffer failed.

An error occurred when the database server tried to allocate the transport
buffers.

Note all circumstances, save a copy of the ON-Bar activity log and
database server message log, and contact GBase Technical Support.


-23982	XBAR error: Free transport buffer failed.

An error occurred when the database server tried to free the transport
buffers.

Note all circumstances, save a copy of the ON-Bar activity log and
database server message log, and contact GBase Technical Support.


-24100	Cannot alter index lock mode.

An attempt to alter the lock mode of an index has failed.

Check the accompanying ISAM error code for more information.


-24101	Cannot specify lock mode for an index on a temporary table.

The temporary tables are session specific, which implies that there
will not be any locking contention between different users. For this
reason, altering the lock mode of an index on such tables is not
deemed necessary.


-24112	Cannot update column (%s).

This error is generated when a user tries to update a column that
is not from the target table. For example:

   create table tab1 (col1 int, col2 int);
   create table tab2 (col3 int, col4 int);
   update tab1 set col4 = col3 + 1 from tab1, tab2 where col1 = col4;

This will generate the following error because the column col4 is not
from the target table tab1:

   24112: Cannot update column (col4).
   Error in line 1
   Near character position 1


-24113	Table (<tabname>) is not a duplicated table.

The attempted operation is valid only for duplicated tables.
<tabname> is not a duplicated table.

Specify a duplicated table and retry the operation.


-24114	Number of dbspace lists does not match number of fragments
in table.

In the CREATE DUPLICATE statement, the number of supplied dbspace
lists must match the number of fragments in the original table.

Rewrite the CREATE DUPLICATE statement and specify a list
of dbspaces for each original fragment of the table.


-24115	Number of dbspaces per dbspace list must be identical.

In the CREATE DUPLICATE statement, the number of dbspaces in each
dbspace list must be the same.

Rewrite the statement to satisfy this criterion. Remember that
dbslices are expanded into their component dbspaces, excluding
a dbspace that the original table uses.


-24116	Duplicate dbspace (<dbsname>) detected in CREATE DUPLICATE
specification.

A dbspace name occurs more than once in this statement. In a CREATE
DUPLICATE you cannot specify a dbspace name more than once.

Rewrite the statement using only unique dbspace names. Remember that
dbslices are expanded into their component dbspaces, excluding a dbspace
that the original table uses.


-24117	Dbspace (<dbsname>) in CREATE DUPLICATE specification already
exists in table.

The specified dbspace already contains a fragment of the table,
so you cannot use the dbspace name in the CREATE DUPLICATE command.

Rewrite the statement to avoid specifying any dbspace that the original
table already uses.


-24118	This ddl operation is not allowed due to deferred
constraints pending on this table and dependent tables.

This transaction is running with constraint checking deferred.
After executing a DML command (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), a DDL command
was executed on the same table. To check the pending constraints, the
schema of the table cannot be changed. DDL commands can change the
schema of the table; therefore, they are not allowed. If this table
has a primary key and there is a foreign key referencing it, 
schema changes are not allowed on the table containing the foreign
key. This is to check pending referential constraints. The table
containing the foreign key is also referred to as a dependent table.

If you would like to change the schema of the table, first set the
constraint mode to immediate and then retry the failing DDL command.


-24120	Cannot use dbinfo function in HAVING clause.

The dbinfo function cannot be used in the HAVING clause of a query.


-24121	Data Dictionary locking error (%s).

This error can occur when there is a conflict between a DML statement
running on a given table and a concurrent DDL statement trying to
modify that same table. The table name is specified in the error
message. This conflict can occur between 2 different users, or even
with a single user if that single user has an open cursor on the table
being modified. In the latter case, the ISAM error code will be set
to -106, non-exclusive access. The combination of SQL error
code -24121 and ISAM error code -106 will uniquely indentify this
situation.

The corrective action is to first close any cursors that reference
the table being modified. The ISAM error code can give further details
on the particular conflict resolution in the event the problem
is multi-user related. For example, the error code might indicate that
a timeout has occurred. In that case, the corrective action might be
to increase the wait time (set by the command SET LOCK MODE TO WAIT).
Other error codes can indicate that a deadlock has occurred and you
can look up the recommendations for the ISAM error code for
descriptions and corrective actions.

This situation is not influenced by ISOLATION LEVEL and can occur at
any isolation level. This internal locking that occurs is necessary
to enforce consistent metadata. Without this consistency, a variety of
unpredictable and inconsistent, potentially fatal, errors can occur.


-24122	Column not specified for hash/hybrid fragmentation and there is
no primary key for the table.

When a table is created with hash or hybrid fragmentation, if no
column is specified as the hash key in hash or hybrid fragmentation, then
the database server uses the primary key for the table as the hash key.
This error occurred because there is no primary key for the table and no
hash column was specified.

For example, the following statement will get error -24122:

   create table tab (
       c1 int,
       c1 int,
       c2 char(10)
   ) fragment by hybrid expression
           c1 < 1000 in db1,
           remainder in db2;
  
There are two ways to fix this statement. 
  
   1). Add a hybrid column:
   
          create table tab1 (
              c1 int,
              c2 char(10)
          ) fragment by hybrid(c2) expression
                  c1 < 1000 in db1,
                  remainder in db2;
  
   2). Add a primary key:
   
          create table tab2 (
              c1 int primary key,
              c2 char(10)
          ) fragment by hybrid expression
                  c1 < 1000 in db1,
                  remainder in db2;


-24123	Blobs are not allowed in the "Union" clause.

You selected a TEXT or BYTE column in a UNION query. The SELECT clause
of each query cannot include any TEXT or BYTE columns. These columns
are not allowed in a UNION clause because TEXT and BYTE columns cannot
be tested for equality. A UNION ALL clause, however, can include TEXT
and BYTE columns (in a standalone SELECT statement or in a UNION view).


-24134	XA transaction aborted.

Statements that were active when the transaction aborted will fail and
will be rolled back.

No action is required.


-24135	Cannot prepare XA transaction.

The database server cannot prepare a distributed transaction.
The transaction has been aborted.

Report this error to your DBA or DBSA.


-24136	CREATE DATABASE: dbspace '<dbsname>' not found on coserver one.

In a version 8.x database server, you can only create databases  in
dbspaces on the first coserver.

Check the dbspace name you specified for the correct spelling. If the
spelling is correct, see your database server administrator for the name
of a dbspace that exists on coserver one. If you do not specify a
dbspace in the CREATE DATABASE statement, the database server uses the
dbspace specified in the ONCONFIG file parameter DBCREATE_DBS.


-24142	Permission denied: User cannot set mutability for environment variables.

Only a user with DBA privileges can set the mutability property of a session environment variable.
The statements that set mutability for environment variables are typically used by DBA in a sysdbopen() procedure 
to affect a user session.


-24143	Session environment variable <varname> is immutable. Contact DBA.

DBA has made this session environment variable immutable. Contact DBA to have
this property changed.

-24145	Only permanent(base) tables can be moved.

Only user-created permanent tables can be moved across databases. The 
following table types cannot be moved:
    * TEMP and SCRATCH tables
    * System catalog tables
    * Active violation tables
    * Views


-24146	Username and rolename have conflicting permissions.

During the execution of the MOVE TABLE command, one of the following 
situations may have occurred:

    * A rolename in the source database conflicts with a username in 
      the destination database
    * A username in the source database conflicts with a  rolename in 
      the destination database.

To correct this error:
    * Do not use the ROLES option in the WITH clause of a MOVE TABLE 
      command
    * Do not use the WITH clause with the MOVE TABLE command
    * Revoke these conflicting permissions manually before executing
      a MOVE TABLE command.


-24147	Source and destination database must be different.

Use the MOVE TABLE command to move a table to a different database. 
Use the RENAME TABLE command to move a table within the same database.


-24148	Cannot move a table from the sysmaster and sysutils databases.

You cannot move a table from either 'sysmaster' or 'sysutils' system
databases.


-24149	Owner name conflicts with role name in the destination database.

During execution of the MOVE TABLE command, a conflict occurred between the target owner name and 
the existing role name in the destination database.

To correct this error:
    * Drop the conflicting role from the destination database.
    * Use the RENAME option with the MOVE TABLE command to specify a 
      different target owner name, as in the following example:
          - MOVE TABLE 'o1'.t1 TO DATABASE destdb RENAME '02'.t1;


-24150	Only users with DBA privileges can move the table.

Only users with DBA privileges on both the source and destination 
databases are allowed to execute the MOVE TABLE statement.


-24200	RQM Error: Cannot find the session.

This error is reported when rmfindsession cannot find a session
according to a session ID.


-24201	RQM Error: Cannot find statement sdb.

This error is reported when the parent statement descriptor
cannot be found for UPDATE CURRENT.


-24300	Column (%s) not found in the target table.

This error is generated when a user tries to insert into a column that
is not from the target table. For example:

        create table bonus (id int, bonus int);
        create table emp(id int, salary int);

        MERGE INTO bonus D
        USING emp S ON D.id = S.id
        WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET bonus = bonus + salary*.01
        WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (id, salary) VALUES (S.id, salary);

This will generate the following error because salary in the insert column
list is not from the target table, bonuses:

        24300: Column (salary) not found in the target table.
        Error in line 4
        Near character position 41


-24301	Table (%s) is not the target table.

This error is generated when a user tries to insert into a column that
is not from the target table. For example:

        create table bonus (id int, bonus int);
        create table emp(id int, salary int);

        MERGE INTO bonus D
        USING emp S ON D.id = S.id
        WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET bonus = bonus + salary*.01
        WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (id, emp.bonus) VALUES (S.id, salary);

This will generate the following error because the emp.bonus table name is not
the bonus target table:

        24301: Table (emp) is not the target table.
        Error in line 4
        Near character position 47


-24302	Column (%s) not found in the source table.

This error is generated when a user tries to insert into the target table using
a column from the target table. For example:

        create table bonus (id int, bonus int);
        create table emp(id int, salary int);

        MERGE INTO bonus D
        USING emp S ON D.id = S.id
        WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET bonus = bonus + salary*.01
        WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (D.id, D.bonus) VALUES (S.id, bonus);

This will generate the following error because in the VALUE clause the
bonus column is not from the emp source table:

        24302: Column (bonus) not found in the source table.
        Error in line 4
        Near character position 66


-24303	Table (%s) is not the source table.

This error is generated when a user tries to insert into the
target table using the column from the target table. For example:

        create table bonus (id int, bonus int);
        create table emp(id int, salary int);

        MERGE INTO bonus D
        USING emp S ON D.id = S.id
        WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET bonus = bonus + salary*.01
        WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (D.id, D.bonus) VALUES (D.id, salary);

This will generate the following error because the salary column in the VALUE clause
is not from the source table, emp:

        24303: Table (d) is not the source table.
        Error in line 4
        Near character position 61


-25539	Invalid connection-type.

an NFS- or RFS-mounted file system. However, no entry exists with the
NFS or RFS host for the dbservername that is listed in the sqlhosts
file. Ask your GBase database administrator to add the entry to the
sqlhosts file. If you are using GBase SE, be sure that an sqlexecd
daemon is running on the NFS or RFS host.


-25559	DBPATH server server-name is not listed as a dbserver name in sqlhosts.

The database server that your DBPATH environment variable setting
specifies is not listed in the $GBASEDBTDIR/etc/sqlhosts file. Check
that every database server that is mentioned in DBPATH corresponds to
an entry in the sqlhosts file.


-25560	Environment variable GBASEDBTSERVER must be set.

The GBASEDBTSERVER environment variable must specify a default database
server. Use a setenv command in C shell or a set command in Bourne
shell to set GBASEDBTSERVER.


-25561	Invalid authentication type.

-25570	Network driver cannot execute the fork system call.

A system call has failed. See the system administrator for assistance.


-25571	Cannot create a user thread.

The database server cannot create or spawn a user thread for a client
that is trying to establish a connection.

Probable causes of the error and corrective actions include:

   *   The database server cannot allocate system resources for the
       user thread at the moment. The client can retry the connection
       later. When other clients finish their work, some system resources
       should become available again. Check to see if the user is the right
       person to execute the utility or the program. For information about
       who can use what utilities, refer to the Trusted Facility Manual or
       your Administrator's Guide.

   *   A user who is not allowed to use a particular client application
       to connect to the database server tried to use the utility

       group that can access the database server. For more information
       about DBSSO users, see the Trusted Facility Manual.


-25572	Network driver cannot bind a name to the port.

A system call has failed. The sqlexecd daemon or database server cannot
access the network port that is specified by the servicename in the
sqlhosts file. This situation might occur because the network port is
already in use by another sqlexecd, database server, or other
application. Use a different servicename on the command line (prior to
Version 6.0) or in the sqlhosts file (beginning with Version 6.0).
Contact your system administrator for assistance.


-25573	Network driver cannot accept a connection on the port.

freeing memory. Retry the connection and then see the system
administrator for assistance.


-25582	Network connection is broken.

The connection terminated because the network is down, the database server
is offline, or the client is offline. If you receive this error on a client,
check the network connection, and the database server. If you receive this
error on the database server, check the network connection, and the client.


-25583	Unknown network error.

See the system administrator or the network administrator for
assistance.


-25584	Network driver cannot access the server program program-name.

Check that the GBASEDBTSERVER environment variable correctly specifies
the default server name and that the default server name and the
service name entries in the sqlhosts file are correct.


-25585	Invalid buffer size.

The buffer size that is specified in the servicename column is not
valid. Check that the servicename column of your sqlhosts file is
correct.


-25586	Network send failed.

A system call has failed. See the system administrator for assistance.


-25587	Network receive failed.

A system call has failed. Perform a DISCONNECT and then check the
status of the server. See the system administrator for assistance.


-25588	The appl process cannot connect to Dynamic Server <server-name>.

An error in the application can produce this message. Check your
CONNECT statement and the sqlhosts file. A system failure can also
produce this message. If you can find no immediate cause for the
failure, note the circumstances and contact your database server
administrator for assistance.

The shared memory communication subsystem is down or not functioning.
Contact the database server administrator to report the problem.


-25589	Invalid database server mail-box message type.

A system call has failed. See your system administrator for assistance.


-25590	Authentication error.
 
This error indicates that an invalid user ID or password was used to
connect to the database server. Provide a valid user ID and password.
 
This error can also occur if the CSM option is enabled on the database
server side but disabled on the client application side, or vice versa.
If you want to use a CSM, make sure that the CSM option is set in the
sqlhosts file for both the database server and client application.


-25591	Transport control received an invalid connection address.

Check the hostname and servicename entries in the $GBASEDBTDIR/etc/sqlhosts
file for the desired database server. Verify with the DBA and the system
administrator that the hostname and servicename are spelled correctly. If
you are using TCP/IP, also verify that the hostname and servicename have
corresponding entries in the /etc/hosts and the /etc/services files,
respectively, on the client computer.


-25592	Communications service not supported by network driver.

The network service that was requested for this connection, such as TCP
with sockets or TCP with TLI, is not available on the desired system or
the specified database server. Use a supported network service; verify
that the nettype field is correctly specified for the desired database
server in the $GBASEDBTDIR/etc/sqlhosts file. If the network service is
available on the system but not on the database server, ask your DBA to
turn on the service when the DBA initializes the database server.


-25593	Network listener failed to make an open I/O channel to be non-blocking.

Report this operating-system error to the operating-system
administrator. It might require a system reboot.


-25594	Shared Memory client failed to alert the database server for service.

There are two possible reasons for this error:

If the error number is zero, the problem is memory corruption.

If the error number is not zero, an operating system call failed, usually 
because a semaphore operation could not be performed. 

Report the problem to the system administrator, who should restart the 
database server or restart the computer. In either case, call GBase Technical Support. 
For operating system call failure, Support might advise you to set the 
environment variables IFX_SEMOP_INTERVAL or IFX_SEMOP_RETRY.


-25595	Invalid message received during connection attempt.

An error occurred when you tried to connect to the desired database server.

If you are using GBase Database Server, GBase Database Server, or
GBase Database Server, verify that the database server is still
online. If you are using GBase SE, verify that the sqlexecd daemon
for the database server is still running. Also, verify that the
$GBASEDBTDIR/etc/sqlhosts file entry for the database server is correct.


-25596	The GBASEDBTSERVER value is not listed in the sqlhosts file or the
Registry.

The default database server name that the GBASEDBTSERVER environment
variable specifies must be a valid database server name in the file
$GBASEDBTDIR/etc/sqlhosts on UNIX or the registry on Windows. Check
that the specified server is listed in the sqlhosts file or the
registry.


-25597	Error in system pipe processing.

This system failure might indicate a problem accessing environment
variables. Note the system error number and see the operating-system
administrator for assistance.


-25598	Communications usage error: Invalid state transition.

If this internal error recurs, note all circumstances and
contact GBase Technical Support.


-25599	Network connection error - no listener.

The client application is attempting to connect to a remote server.
However, no listener daemon is running on the remote host. Check that
the listener daemon is started on the remote host and retry the
connection.


-25600	The relay module cannot get environment variable SQLRM.  System error
error-number.

Check with your system administrator for problems with the system.


-25601	This relay module cannot execute relay module module-name for another
protocol.

Validate that the named relay module is installed on your system.


-25602	The local database server server-name cannot be forked by the relay
module.  System error number.

Check with your system administrator for problems with the system.


-25603	Attempt to prepare more than one statement before connecting to a
database.

Check your application to make sure that you prepare only one of the
CREATE DATABASE, START DATABASE, or DROP DATABASE statements before you
connect to a database.


-25604	The database name syntax conflicts with the options in the statement.

Check your application to make sure that your database syntax uses the
correct options accordingly in the statements.


-25605	SQLEXEC must be set to create a local database using the relay module.

Check that you have set the SQLEXEC environment variable to the local
GBase SE database server (for database servers prior to Version
6.0).


-25606	Unknown product identification string in the database server on the
local machine.

Check that you have installed the database server.


-25607	Statement not supported. Database not selected yet.

You issued an SQL statement that requires an open database, but you did
not select a database. Select the desired database and retry the
statement.


-25700	UUID Cache corrupted/not initialized.

The database server's list of server UUIDs has become corrupted.

If this error recurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase 
Technical Support.


-25701	The specified servername <servername> is not in SYSSERVERS.

You attempted to use ALTER SERVERUUID <servername> with a database server
name that is not in the sysservers table of the syscdr database.

Modify the ALTER SERVERUUID statement to use a database server name that
is in the sysservers table.


-25702	Error receiving the UUID from remote server <servername>.

If this error recurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase 
Technical Support.


-25703	UUID cache not initialized.

If this error recurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase 
Technical Support.


-25704	Attempt to increment/decrement the reference count on a remote
smartblob.

You cannot update the reference count for a large object (BLOB or CLOB) that
is on a remote server. Also, you cannot store references to a local large
object in a remote table.

Verify that all commands that manage reference counts refer only to large
objects that are in the local database.


-25705	Invalid UUID. Server name corresponding to the UUID cannot be
located.

If this error recurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase 
Technical Support.


-25706	Attempt to delete ServerUuid entry for the local server.

You issued the statement DROP SERVERUUID <servername> where <servername> is
the current database server. A database server cannot drop its own UUID. 

Change <servername> in your DROP SERVERUUID statement. 


-25707	Attempt to alter ServerUuid entry for local server.

You issued the statement ALTER SERVERUUID <servername> where <servername> is
the current database server. A database server cannot alter its own UUID. 

Change <servername> in your ALTER SERVERUUID statement.


-25708	Unable to find servername from UUID.

This error can arise when a client application gets a UUID from one database
server and attempts to use that UUID on another system. If, on the second
database server, the sysserver table of the syscdr database is not up-to-
date, the UUID value on the second database server might either be missing
or disagree with the UUID value on the first database server.

Suppose you had three database servers, A, B, and C. Database server A has
communicated with C, thus causing the syscdr tables on A and C to be updated.
However, database server B has never communicated with C, so the syscdr
database on B does not contain a UUID for C. If the application obtains a
large-object handle from A that refers to a large object on C and then sends
that LO handle to B, B can tell that the LO handle refers to a remote site 
but cannot resolve the UUID.

Check the source of the UUID value. Verify that the UUID value is from
the database server on which you are attempting to use it or verify
that the syscdr databases are up-to-date on both database servers.


-25710	Invalid routine structure in server to server fastpath call.

This error can occur if you use an invalid MI_FUNC_DESC value.

However, the error is probably an internal error. If the error recurs, 
note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-25711	No more than three connections can be involved in a single
fastpath call. 

You executed a routine that opens a remote connection that in turn calls
another routine that opens a remote connection, and so on. The result is that
the nested routines try to open more than the maximum allowed number of
connections.

Examine your routines and reduce the number of connections requested. 


-25712	Routine <routine_name> cannot be called from a remote server. 

The database server cannot access the routine <routine_name> from a remote 
database server.

Install <routine_name> on your local database server before calling it.


-25713	Attempting to run a cross server routine <routine_name> in
parallel.

You have attempted to execute a routine on a remote database server in
parallel.Routines that execute remotely should not be parallelizable.

Remove the PARALLELIZABLE modifier from the definition of the routine
<routine_name>.


-25718	Cannot insert or update from a nonlogging database to a logging
database.

When the local database is nonlogging, the only operations allowed on
a remote database are operations that read information. You cannot change
information on a remote database when the local database is nonlogging.

Remove the insert or update operation, or change the local database to a
logging database, or change the remote database to a nonlogging database.


-25720	Invalid combination of modifiers DISTRIBUTEBINARY and <modifer>.

An opaque data type cannot have the both the modifier <modifier> and 
DISTRIBUTEBINARY.

Modify your CREATE OPAQUE TYPE or ALTER OPAQUE TYPE statement to remove the 
inappropriate modifier.


-25721	Invalid combination of modifiers ISCANONICAL and DONOTDISTRIBUTE.

An opaque data type cannot have both the ISCANONICAL and DONOTDISTRIBUTE
attributes.

Modify your CREATE OPAQUE TYPE or ALTER OPAQUE TYPE statement to remove one
of the modifiers.


-25722	Invalid combination of modifiers DONOTDISTRIBUTE and
DISTRIBUTESREFERENCES.

An opaque data type cannot have both the DONOTDISTRIBUTE and
DISTRIBUTESREFERENCES attributes.

Modify your CREATE OPAQUE TYPE or ALTER OPAQUE TYPE statement to remove one
of the modifiers.


-25723	A modifier may not appear more than once in an ALTER statement.

An ALTER OPAQUE TYPE statement includes a repeated mention of a modifier such
as DONOTDISTRIBUTE or ISCANONICAL.

Examine your statement and remove the repeated modifier.


-25724	May not modify built-in type <data_type_name>.

Only user-defined data types are valid with the ALTER OPAQUE TYPE statement.
The data type <data_type_name> is a built-in data type.

Remove the ALTER OPAQUE TYPE statement.


-25725	Attempt to add duplicate modifier <modifier>.

The opaque data type in your ALTER OPAQUE TYPE statement already includes the
modifier <modifier>. 

Remove <modifier> from the ALTER OPAQUE TYPE statement.


-25726	Attempt to drop non-existent modifier <modifier>.

The modifier that you supplied in the DROP <modifier> clause of 
ALTER OPAQUE TYPE is not a modifier for that opaque type. You cannot drop a
modifier that is not present. 

Correct your ALTER OPAQUE TYPE statement. To find the modifiers that are 
associated with the opaque type, use the following statement:

   SELECT * from sysxtdtypes WHERE name = <opaque_type_name>.


-25727	Modifier <modifier> is incompatible with SRVSENDRECV/DBSENDRECV
cast.

You cannot create a srvsendrecv or dbsendrecv cast for an opaque type defined
with the modifier <modifier>.

Remove <modifier> from the definition of the data type or drop the cast.


-25728	Type <data_type_name> is not the same in the local and remote
database.

The attributes of the user-defined data type <data_type_name> are different
on the local and remote databases. A UDT used in a distributed query must
have the same attributes in all databases accessed by the query. 

Examine the definition of the <data_type_name> UDT in both your local and
remote databases. Modify one or both of the UDTs so that they are the same.

You can use the oncheck utility to check for compatible data types between
servers. For example: 

   oncheck -cvt db1@server1 db2@server2.


-25729	Type <opaque_type_name> may not be used in a distributed query
(DONOTDISTRIBUTE).

The user-defined type <opaque_type_name> was created with the DONOTDISTRIBUTE
modifier. UDTs with the DONOTDISTRIBUTE attribute cannot be used in queries
that access more than one database. 

Modify the query or change the attributes of the <opaque_type_name> data 
type.


-25731	Error Opening the Remote File <opaque_type_name>.

The database server could not open the requested remote file. Possible causes
of the failure include: 

   The file does not exist.
   The permissions on the file do not permit this user to access the file.
   The file specification is wrong. 

Verify that the remote file exists, that its access permissions are set
correctly, and that the syntax of the filename is correct. Remote
files names must be specified with <filename>@<servername>.


-25733	Error Reading from the Remote File.

The database server could not read the requested remote file. Possible causes
of this error include:

   The file does not exist.
   The permissions on the file do not permit this user to access the file.
   The file specification is wrong. 

Verify that the access permissions are set correctly, and that the syntax of
the filename is correct. Remote filenames must be specified with
<filename>@<servername>.


-25736	The extended type <data_type_name> has not been defined in the
local database.

The data type <data_type_name> does not have a definition on the local
database. All extended data types that are used in distributed queries
must be defined in both the local and remote databases.

Make sure that <data_type_name> is defined in both the local and remote
databases and that the definitions have the same attributes.


-25737	Cluster Indexes cannot be created in an online environment.

ONLINE keyword isn't supported for cluster indexes.


-25738	Index can be created online only for btree secondary access method.

An index can be successfully created with the ONLINE keyword only if the
secondary access method is btree.


-25745	UUID already exists for <servername>.

You issued a CREATE UUID <servername> for a database server that already is
associated with a UUID. That is, <servername> is included in the sysservers
table of the syscdr database.

If the database server <servername> has a new UUID because it was
reinitialized, use ALTER SERVERUUID <servername> to update the UUID in the
sysservers table. 

If the database server <servername> no longer exists, you can use 
DROP SERVERUUID to remove the entry from the sysservers table. It is not
necessary to remove a nonexistent database server from sysservers. Leaving 
the entry in the sysservers table does not cause problems.


-25746	UUID does not exist for <servername>.

You cannot DROP SERVERUUID <servername> or ALTER SERVERUUID <servername>
unless <servername> is associated with a UUID in the sysservers table of the
syscdr database.

To find the names of database servers whose UUIDs exist, use the following
query: 

   SELECT * FROM syscdr:sysservers.


-25747	Do not have permissions to execute the drop serveruuid statement.

You must be a DBA to use to DROP SERVERUUID statement.

-25789	The file name in SET EXPLAIN FILE or SET DEBUG FILE must be a non-null string.

The argument specified for the file name in the SET EXPLAIN FILE or
SET DEBUG FILE statement must be a non-null character data type (CHAR
or VARCHAR).


-25790	File name in SET EXPLAIN FILE or SET DEBUG FILE statement is too long.

The file name provided in the SET EXPLAIN FILE or SET DEBUG FILE statement is
longer than maximum allowed length of 256 bytes.  Rename the file or store it
in a directory with a shorter path.

-25791	Cannot execute privileged built-in Java routine without the EXTEND role or DBSA authority.

For security reasons, only a DBSA or users who have been granted the EXTEND
role, if the IFX_EXTEND_ROLE configuration parameter is enabled, can execute
the following built-in Java routines:
install_jar, remove_jar, replace_jar, install_jar_deploy, remove_jar_undeploy,
alter_java_path, setUDTExtName, and unsetUDTExtName


-25800	Cannot specify overlapping fragment expressions for interval or list fragmentation.

The fragment expressions for interval or list fragmentation cannot overlap.
For example, the following statement generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE address (street VARCHAR(128), city VARCHAR(32),
                          state CHAR(2), zip INT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 5000 IN dbs3,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs4;

The partition p2 and p3 are overlapping. The fragment expressions for p2 and
p3 are the same.

The following statement also generates an error:

    CREATE INDEX add_state_idx ON address(state)
        FRAGMENT BY LIST(state)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES ('CA','OR') IN dbs1,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES ('NY', 'NJ', 'CA') IN dbs2,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES (NULL) IN dbs3,
            PARTITION p4 REMAINDER IN dbs3;

The partition p1 and p2 are overlapping. The value 'CA' appears in both p1
and p2 partitions.


-25801	Cannot specify a dbspace more than once in the STORE IN clause.

A dbspace cannot be specified more than once in the STORE IN clause. For
example, the following statement generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE address (street VARCHAR(128), city VARCHAR(32),
                          state CHAR(2), zip INT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs1)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 5000 IN dbs3,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES < 20000 IN dbs4;

The dbspace dbs1 appears twice in the STORE IN clause.


-25802	The PARTITION clause is mandatory for interval and list fragmentation.

The PARTITION clause is mandatory for interval and list fragmentation.
A partition name must be specified following the PARTITION keyword. For
example, the following statement generates an error:

    CREATE INDEX add_zip_idx ON address(zip)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3;

The following statement is correct:

    CREATE INDEX add_zip_idx ON address(zip)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3;


-25803	Interval or list fragmentation must have at least one non-null, non-remainder fragment.

At least one fragment that is not a null fragment and is also not a
remainder fragment must be specified for interval or list fragmentation
definitions. A "null fragment" is a fragment that can only store NULL
data values, A "remainder fragment" is a fragment defined with the REMAINDER
keyword.

The following statements generate an error:

    CREATE TABLE address (street VARCHAR(128), city VARCHAR(32),
                          state CHAR(2), zip INT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES IS NULL IN dbs3;

    CREATE INDEX add_state_idx ON address(state)
        FRAGMENT BY LIST(state)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES (NULL) IN dbs2,
            PARTITION p2 REMAINDER IN dbs3;

The above statements violates the interval and list fragmentation requirement
that at least one fragment be neither a null nor a remainder fragment.

The following statements are correct:

    CREATE TABLE address (street VARCHAR(128), city VARCHAR(32),
                          state CHAR(2), zip INT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3;

    CREATE INDEX add_state_idx ON address(state)
        FRAGMENT BY LIST(state)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES ('CA','OR') IN dbs1,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES (NULL) IN dbs2,
            PARTITION p4 REMAINDER IN dbs3;

    CREATE INDEX add_zip_idx ON address(zip)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES IS NULL IN dbs4;

In the statements abvoe, the p1 fragment is a non-null, non-remainder
fragment, thereby satisfying the requirement for interval and list
fragmentation.


-25804	The interval value must be a non-zero positive constant.

The resultant value of the expression for the interval value must be a non-zero
positive constant. For example, the following statement generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE address (street VARCHAR(128), city VARCHAR(32),
                          state CHAR(2), zip INT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(-1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3;

The interval value is negative.

The following statement also generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE address (street VARCHAR(128), city VARCHAR(32),
                          state CHAR(2), zip INT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(zip) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3;

The interval value is the column zip, which is not a constant.


-25805	The interval value must be a numeric or INTERVAL data type.

The resultant data type of the expression for an interval value must satisfy
one of these two sets of conditions:
    <1>  If the fragment key is a numeric type, the expression must return
             a built-in numeric data type.  This cannot be a MONEY data type,
             and it cannot have a fractional part.

    <2>  If the fragment key is a  DATE or DATETIME type, the expression
             must return an INTERVAL data type whose last field qualifier
             cannot be a FRACTION.

The following statements generate an error:

    CREATE TABLE address (street VARCHAR(128), city VARCHAR(32),
                          state CHAR(2), zip INT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL("123") STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3;

The interval value "123" is not a numeric or INTERVAL data type.

    CREATE INDEX add_zip_idx ON address(zip)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(1000.20) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3;

The interval value 1000.20 has a fractional part.

The following statement is correct:

    CREATE INDEX add_zip_idx ON address(zip)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(zip)
        INTERVAL(100+900) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3;

The interval value (100+900)is an expression whose result is numeric without
a fractional part.


-25806	The fragment key for interval fragmentation must be a numeric, DATE, or DATETIME type.

The fragment key, which is the column expression on which the table or index is
fragmented, must be a numeric, DATE, or DATETIME type. For example, the
following statement generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE address (street VARCHAR(128), city VARCHAR(32),
                          state CHAR(2), zip INT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(city)
        INTERVAL(5) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs3;

The fragment key is the column city, which is of type CHAR.

The following statements are correct:

    CREATE TABLE orders (order_num INT, order_date DATE, customer_num INT,
                         ship_instruct_code CHAR(1))
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(order_date)
        INTERVAL(INTERVAL(3) MONTH TO MONTH) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATE('01/01/2009') IN dbs1;

    CREATE INDEX ord_ship_idx ON orders(ship_instruct_code)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(ASCII(ship_instruct_code))
        INTERVAL(10) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 65 IN dbs1;


-25807	The fragment key for interval fragmentation must be a single column expression.

The fragment key, which is the column expression on which the table or index is
fragmented, must be a single column expression. For example, the following
statement generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(ROUND(basepay+varpay))
        INTERVAL(2000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 0 IN dbs3;

The fragment key references two columns, basepay and varpay, which is not
allowed.


-25808	The expression defining the upper limit of each fragment must be a constant.

The fragment expression for interval fragmentation is of the form
VALUES < <upper_limit_expr>. The expression for the upper limit must be a
constant. For example, the following statement generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(emp_id)
        INTERVAL(2000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < emp_id+1 IN dbs3;

The upper limit of fragment p1 is a column expression, emp_id+1, which
is not a constant.


-25809	One or more dbspaces specified in the STORE IN clause does not exist.

One or more dbspaces specified in the STORE IN clause does not exist. Ensure
that the dbspaces specified in the STORE IN clause exist and are of the
same pagesize. If the table has an initial set of range fragments, the pagesize
of the dbspaces in the STORE IN clause must match the pagesize of the
dbspaces for the range fragments.


-25810	The fragment key, interval value, and upper limit of the fragments are not compatible.

The fragment key (the column expression on which the table or index is
fragmented), the interval value, and the upper limit of fragments are not
compatible data types. For a numeric fragment key, the interval value must be
a numeric type and the upper limit of a fragment must be numeric. For a
fragment key of DATE or DATETIME type, the interval value must be an INTERVAL
type and the upper limit of a fragment must be a DATE or DATETIME type.

The error can also occur in each of the following scenarios:
    - For a fragment key of DATETIME type, the first field qualifier of the
      fragment key is greater than the last field qualifier of the interval
      value.
    - For a fragment key of DATE type, the interval value is not an integer
      multiple of days (i.e the hours, minutes, seconds or fractions are
      nonzero).
    - For a fragment key of DATE or DATETIME type, the first field qualifier
      of the fragment key and the first field qualifier of the upper limit of
      a fragment are not the same.
    - The resultant type of the upper limit of a fragment is not a built-in
      data type.

For example, the following statements generate an error:

  Example 1:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(emp_id)
        INTERVAL(3 UNITS YEAR) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 3000 IN dbs3;

    The fragment key and the upper limit of fragment p1 are numeric,  but the
    interval value is of the incompatible INTERVAL type.

  Example 2:

    CREATE TABLE orders (order_num INT, order_time DATETIME HOUR TO SECOND,
                         customer_num INT, ship_instruct_code CHAR(1))
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(order_time)
        INTERVAL(3 UNITS DAY) 
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATETIME(01:00:00) HOUR TO SECOND IN dbs1;

    In the above example  the first field qualifier (HOUR) of the fragment
    key order_time is greater than the last field qualifier (DAY) of the
    interval value.

    The correct usage is as follows:

    CREATE TABLE orders (order_num INT, order_time DATETIME HOUR TO SECOND,
                         customer_num INT, ship_instruct_code CHAR(1))
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(order_time)
        INTERVAL(3 UNITS HOUR) 
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATETIME(01:00:00) HOUR TO SECOND IN dbs1;

  Example 3:

    CREATE TABLE orders (order_num INT, order_time DATETIME YEAR TO SECOND,
                         customer_num INT, ship_instruct_code CHAR(1))
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(order_time)
        INTERVAL(3 UNITS DAY)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATETIME(01-01 01:00:00) MONTH TO SECOND IN dbs1;

    In the above example, the first field qualifier (YEAR) of the fragment
    key order_time is not same as the first field qualifier (MONTH) of the
    upper limit of the initial range fragment.

    The correct usage is as follows:

    CREATE TABLE orders (order_num INT, order_time DATETIME YEAR TO SECOND,
                         customer_num INT, ship_instruct_code CHAR(1))
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(order_time)
        INTERVAL(3 UNITS DAY)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATETIME(2010-01-01 01:00:00) YEAR TO SECOND IN dbs1;

  Example 4:

    CREATE TABLE orders (order_num INT, order_date DATE,
                         customer_num INT, ship_instruct_code CHAR(1))
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(order_date)
        INTERVAL(3 UNITS HOUR) 
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATE('01/01/2009') IN dbs1;

    In the above example the fragment key order_date is of type DATE
    but the interval value (3 UNITS HOUR) is not an integer multiple of DAY.

    The correct usage is as follows:

    CREATE TABLE orders (order_num INT, order_date DATE,
                         customer_num INT, ship_instruct_code CHAR(1))
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(order_date)
        INTERVAL(24 UNITS HOUR)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATE('01/01/2009') IN dbs1;


-25811	The transition value for interval fragments must be aligned to the boundary of the interval value type.

The transition value, or the upper limit of the last range fragment, must be
aligned to the boundary of the interval value type.

The following requirements apply:
    - For an interval value of any numeric data type, the transition value
      cannot have a fractional part.
    - For an interval value of INTERVAL type whose first field qualifier is
      YEAR or MONTH, the transition value cannot not contain field qualifiers
      smaller than MONTH. Unless the DAY field has a value of 01 and the
      values of any time units smaller than DAY are zero (for example,
      01 00:00:00.00000).
    - For an interval value of INTERVAL type whose first field qualifier is
      DAY or a smaller time unit, the transition value cannot have FRACTION
      as the last field qualifier, unless the FRACTION field has a value of
      zero.

For example, the following statements generate an error:

  Example 1:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(basepay)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 40000.50 IN dbs1,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES < 60000.50 IN dbs2,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES < 80000.50 IN dbs3;

    In the above example the upper limit of first and intermediate range
    fragments can be of any numeric type, but the upper limit of the last
    range fragments (which is the transition value for interval fragments)
    must be an INTEGER. The transition value in the above example, 80000.50,
    has a fractional part.

    The correct usage is as follows:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(basepay)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 40000.50 IN dbs1,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES < 60000.50 IN dbs2,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES < 80001 IN dbs3;

  Example 2:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(hire_date)
        INTERVAL(3 UNITS YEAR) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATE('03/25/2006') IN dbs3;

    In the above example the interval value is specified in units of YEAR, but
    the transition value is not aligned to the year or month boundary.

    The correct usage is as follows:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(hire_date)
        INTERVAL(3 UNITS YEAR) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATE('03/01/2006') IN dbs3;

  Example 3:

    CREATE TABLE orders (order_num INT, order_time DATETIME YEAR TO SECOND,
                         customer_num INT, ship_instruct_code CHAR(1))
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(order_time)
        INTERVAL(INTERVAL(10 12) DAY(2) TO HOUR)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATETIME(2010-03-25 01:00:00.123) YEAR TO FRACTION(3) IN dbs1;

    In the above example the interval value is a DAY(2) TO HOUR interval.
    The INTERVAL field qualifier transition value is not aligned to the
    second boundary (because it contains a nonzero FRACTION value).

    The correct usage is as follows:

    CREATE TABLE orders (order_num INT, order_time DATETIME YEAR TO SECOND,
                         customer_num INT, ship_instruct_code CHAR(1))
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(order_time)
        INTERVAL(INTERVAL(10 12) DAY(2) TO HOUR)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < DATETIME(2010-03-25 01:00:00.000) YEAR TO FRACTION(3) IN dbs1;


-25812	The difference between the old and new transition values must be a multiple of the interval value.

If altering the fragmentation scheme changes the transition value, and the
table or index has interval fragments, then the difference between the old
and new transition values must be a multiple of the interval value.

For example, consider a table with following schema:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(emp_id)
        INTERVAL(3000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 4000 IN dbs1,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES < 6000 IN dbs2,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES < 8000 IN dbs3;

If the above table has interval fragments (added automatically when emp_id 
values 8000 or greater were inserted), then modifying the transition value
to 8500 will not be allowed.

The following statement generates an error:

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee MODIFY INTERVAL TRANSITION TO 8500;

The difference between the new transition value, 8500, and the old transition
value, 8000, is not a multiple of the interval value, 3000.

Similarly, dropping or detaching the transition fragment or the last range
fragment changes the transition value. The gap created by the drop or
detach must be a multiple of the interval value.

The following statement generates an error:

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee DROP PARTITION p3;

The difference between the new transition value, 6000, and the old transition
value, 8000, or the gap created by the drop is not a multiple of the
interval value, 3000.

-25813	The partition name used in the fragmentation scheme is not allowed.

The system-generated partition names for interval fragments start with 'sys_p'.
Therefore, the partition names for initial fragments of an interval fragmented
table or index cannot have names that start with the same characters.

The following statement generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(hire_date)
        INTERVAL(3 UNITS YEAR) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION sys_p1 VALUES < DATE('01/01/2006') IN dbs3;

In the above example the partition name starts with 'sys_p', which is not
allowed, because the 'sys_p' prefix is reserved for system-defined storage
objects.

The correct usage is as follows:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(hire_date)
        INTERVAL(3 UNITS YEAR) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION pt1 VALUES < DATE('01/01/2006') IN dbs3;


-25814	Incorrect argument passed to function NUMTOYMINTERVAL(), NUMTODSINTERVAL(), TO_YMINTERVAL(), or TO_DSINTERVAL().

An incorrect argument has been passed to one of these functions
NUMTOYMINTERVAL(), NUMTODSINTERVAL, TO_YMINTERVAL(), TO_DSINTERVAL().

The formats of these functions are:

NUMTOYMINTERVAL( <NUMBER>, { "YEAR" | "MONTH" } )
  TO_YMINTERVAL( <NUMBER>, { "YEAR" | "MONTH" } )

NUMTODSINTERVAL( <NUMBER>, { "DAY" | "HOUR" | "MINUTE" | "SECOND" } )
  TO_DSINTERVAL( <NUMBER>, { "DAY" | "HOUR" | "MINUTE" | "SECOND" } )

The <NUMBER> variable can be any literal number, or it can be a column with a
data type that resolves to a number.

The following examples show how to use these functions correctly:

execute function NUMTOYMINTERVAL(1.5,"YEAR");
execute function NUMTODSINTERVAL(120,"MINUTE");

Alternatively, you can pass a single string argument to TO_YMINTERVAL(),
and TO_DSINTERVAL():

TO_YMINTERVAL("YY-mm")
TO_DSINTERVAL("DD HH:MM:SS")

Where:
        YY = years
        mm = months
        DD = days
        HH = hours
        MM = minutes
        SS = seconds

The following examples show how to use a string argument with these functions:

execute function TO_YMINTERVAL("15-6");
execute function TO_DSINTERVAL("1 3:3:7");


-25815	The expression defining the list of values for a fragment in list fragmentation must be a constant.

The expression defining the list of values for a fragment in list fragmentation
must be a constant. For example, the following statement generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE customer (cust_id INTEGER, cust_name CHAR(20), state CHAR(2))
        FRAGMENT BY LIST (state)
        PARTITION p0 VALUES ("KS", "IL") IN dbs0,
        PARTITION p1 VALUES (name, "NR") IN dbs2;

One of the values in the list for fragment p1 is a column, which is not a
constant.


-25816	The dbspace <dbsname> does not exist in list of dbspaces for interval fragments.

The specified dbspaces does not exist in list of dbspaces for interval
fragments of the given table table or index. The following query
will give the current list of dbspaces for interval fragments for a table
and its indexes:

    SELECT t.tabname, f.indexname, f.exprtext
        FROM sysfragments f, systables t
        WHERE f.tabid = t.tabid AND
              f.evalpos = -1 AND
              t.tabname = <tabname>;


-25817	Cannot drop or detach the only remaining non-null, non-remainder fragment.

The fragmentation scheme cannot be altered to drop or detach the last
non-null, non-remainder fragment. Interval or list fragmentation must have at
least one non-null, non-remainder fragment.


-25818	The specified operation or syntax is not supported.
 
The specified operation or syntax is not supported with the fragmentation
scheme of the table or index.


-25819	The INTERVAL clause is allowed with interval fragmentation scheme only.
 
The INTERVAL clause can be specified only while altering the fragmentation
scheme of an interval fragmented table/index or altering the fragmentation
scheme to interval fragmentation.


-25820	Cannot attach two non-fragmented tables to create an interval or list fragmented table.
 
For interval and list fragmentation, the surviving table in attach operation
must be fragmented by interval or list. If you want to attach two
non-fragmented tables, initialize the framentation scheme for one of the
non-fragmented tables to interval or list and then attach the second
one to it.


-25821	Internal error: The interval or list fragmented table/index has zero fragments.

An internal error occurred while reading the catalog entries for an interval
or list fragmented table/index. The table/index does not have any fragments.
If this error recurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-25822	Unable to determine fragment position for fragments while moving to new fragmentation scheme.

An error occurred while determining fragment position for fragments in
new fragmentation scheme. The fragment position for one of the fragments
in the new scheme could have exceeded 2147483646. Consider changing the
interval value expression or transition value.


-25823	Cannot specify BEFORE or AFTER clause while adding or attaching a fragment.

The BEFORE or AFTER clause cannot be used while adding or attaching a
fragment to an interval fragmented table/index. The system internally
determines the position of the fragment that is being added ot attached.


-25824	The upper limit of the fragment must be aligned to an interval fragment boundary.

While altering the interval fragmentation scheme to add or attach fragments
above the transition value, the upper limit of the fragment being added
or attached must align at an interval fragment boundary i.e. the
upper limit of the fragment must equal transition value plus a multiple of
the interval value.

For example, the following alter generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(emp_id)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 5000 IN dbs0,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs0;

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee ADD PARTITION p3 VALUES < 15400;

In the above example, a fragment is being added above the transition value
i.e. an interval fragment is being added. The upper limit of the fragment,
15400, is not aligned to an interval fragment boundary.

The correct usage is as follows:

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee ADD PARTITION p3 VALUES < 16000;
      

-25825	Cannot specify remainder fragment for interval fragmentation.

Interval fragmentated tabl or index cannot have remainder fragment.
Rewrite the statement to remove the remainder fragment specification.


-25826	Cannot specify more than one null fragment for interval or list fragmentation.

Interval or list fragmentated table or index cannot have more than one null
fragment. Rewrite the statement to remove the null fragment specification.


-25827	Cannot add or attach a fragment expressions that matches an exisitng fragment expression.

Interval or list fragmentated table or index cannot have overlapping
fragment expressions.


-25828	An error occurred while adding or attaching a fragment to the initial range fragments.

An internal error occurred while adding or attaching a fragment to the initial
fragments of an interval fragmented table or index. Note all circumstances
and contact GBase Technical Support.


-25829	Cannot modify the fragment expression for an interval fragment.

The fragment expression for an interval fragment is system generated
and cannot be modified.


-25830	The new fragment expression cannot cross adjacent fragment boundaries.

While altering the fragmentation scheme to modify the fragment expression of
range fragments, the new fragment expression cannot cross adjacent
fragment boundaries. The new upper limit of the range fragment must be
greater than the upper limit of the previous range fragment and lesser
than that of the next range fragment.

For example, the following alters generate error:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(emp_id)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 5000 IN dbs0,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs0,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES < 20000 IN dbs4,
            PARTITION p4 VALUES < 25000 IN dbs4;

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee MODIFY
        PARTITION p2 TO PARTITION p2 VALUES < 4000 IN dbs0;

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE address MODIFY 
        PARTITION p2 TO PARTITION p2 VALUES < 21000 IN dbs0;

The new fragment expression in both of the above alters crosses adjacent
fragment boundries. The new upper limit 4000 of the first alter is lesser
than the upper limit of previous range fragment p1. Similarly, the new upper
limit 21000 of the second alter is greater than that of the next range
fragment p3. The new upper limit for range fragment p2 must be greater
than 5000 and lesser than 20000.

The correct usage is as follows:

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE address MODIFY 
        PARTITION p2 TO PARTITION p2 VALUES < 12000 IN dbs0;


-25831	Cannot modify fragment expression for transition fragment.

The fragment expression for transition fragment or last range fragment
cannot be modified. However, the MODIFY INTERVAL TRANSITION option
of the ALTER FRAGMENT statement allows modification of the transition
value which in turn can change the fragment expression.

For example, the following alter generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(emp_id)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 5000 IN dbs0,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs0,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES < 20000 IN dbs4;

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee MODIFY 
        PARTITION p3 TO PARTITION p3 VALUES < 25000 IN dbs4;

The fragment expression for transition fragment p3 cannot be modified
using the above syntax.
    
The following statement that modifies the transition value, will indirectly
change the fragment expression for p3:

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee MODIFY INTERVAL TRANSITION TO 25000;


-25832	Internal error: Could not modify the transition value.

An internal error occurred while modifying the transition value. If this
error recurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-25833	Internal error: The compact representation of fragment partitioning could not be constructed.

An internal error occured while constructing the compact representation of
fragment partitioning for interval or list fragmented table/index.
The fragment expressions either overlap or are non-linear.


-25834	The specified alter fragment operation cannot be performed online.

Online alter fragment is supported only with interval fragmented tables.
The following operations can be performed online:
    - attaching interval fragment
    - detaching interval fragment
    - modifying transition value

The following conditions apply for attaching an interval fragment online:
    - The surviving table has to be an interval fragmented table.
    - The consumed table has to be non-fragmented. Only one table can
      be attached at a time.
    - All indexes on the surviving table has to be fragmented same as table
      i.e. all indexes must be attached.
    - For each index on the surviving table, there must be a matching index
      on the consumed table i.e. index on the same set of columns.
    - The indexes on the consumed table must be detached and stored in a
      single dbspace. The dbspace for the index must be same as the dbspace
      for the consumed table.
    - If the index on the surviving table is unique, the corresponding
      matching index on the consumed table must be unique.
    - The consumed table must have a check constraint that exactly matches
      the fragment expression being attached and must span a single interval
      only. This is necessary to ensure no data movement.

The following conditions apply for detaching an interval fragment online:
    - The surviving table has to be an interval fragmented table.
    - All indexes on the surviving table has to be fragmented same as table
      i.e. all indexes must be attached.


-25835	The transition value specified is not valid.

While altering the fragmentation scheme to modify the transition value,
the new transition value must be greater than old transition value.
If there are interval fragments following the new transition value then
the new transition value must align at an interval fragment boundary.

For example, consider a table with following schema:
  
    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(emp_id)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 4000 IN dbs1,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES < 6000 IN dbs2,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES < 8000 IN dbs3;

The following statement generates an error:

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee MODIFY INTERVAL TRANSITION TO 7000;

The transition value can only be increased. In the above example, the new
transition value is lesser than the old one.

Lets assume the table has two interval fragments,
    sys_p4  >= 8000 AND < 9000
    sys_p6  >= 10000 AND < 11000

The following statement generates an error:

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee MODIFY INTERVAL TRANSITION TO 8500;

The new transition value 8500 is not aligned at an interval fragment boundary.

The following usage is correct:

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE address MODIFY INTERVAL TRANSITION TO 9000;
    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE address MODIFY INTERVAL TRANSITION TO 10000;

The new transition values 9000 and 10000 are aligned at an interval fragment
boundary.

The following usage is also correct:

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE address MODIFY INTERVAL TRANSITION TO 12500;

Since there are no interval fragments beyond the new transition value, the
new transition value need not align at an interval fragment boundary.


-25836	The transition value must be a non-null constant.

The transition value must be a non-null constant expression.
For example, the following alter generates an error:

    CREATE TABLE employee (emp_id INTEGER, emp_name CHAR(64), ssn CHAR(12),
                           basepay FLOAT, varpay FLOAT, dept_id SMALLINT,
                           hire_date DATE)
        FRAGMENT BY RANGE(emp_id)
        INTERVAL(1000) STORE IN (dbs1, dbs2, dbs3)
            PARTITION p1 VALUES < 5000 IN dbs0,
            PARTITION p2 VALUES < 10000 IN dbs0,
            PARTITION p3 VALUES < 20000 IN dbs4;

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee MODIFY INTERVAL TRANSITION TO emp_id+10;

The new tranisition value, emp_id+10 is a column expression and not a constant.


-25837	Cannot truncate an index fragment.

An index fragment cannot be truncated. The TRUNCATE option of the
ALTER FRAGMENT statement is supported only with table fragments.


-25838	Duplicate partition name in the list of fragments for truncation.

A partition name was specified more than once in the TRUNCATE clause of the
ALTER FRAGMENT statement.
For example, the following statements generate an error:

    ALTER FRAGMENT ON TABLE employee TRUNCATE PARTITION p1, PARTITION p1,
                                              PARTITION p2; 

The partition p1 appears twice in the TRUNCATE clause.


-25839	Internal error: Could not find the transition fragment.

The transition fragment is missing. If this internal error recurs,
note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-25840	An error occurred during online attach of fragment.

An error occurred during online attach of fragment. Check the accompanying
ISAM error code for more information.


-25841	An error occurred during online detach of fragment.

An error occurred during online detach of fragment. Check the accompanying
ISAM error code for more information.


-25842	An online alter fragment operation cannot be performed in a transaction that has modified objects in a database.

The online alter fragment operation must be the first operation in the
transaction that does any kind of modification.


-25843	An online alter fragment operation cannot be performed in a transaction that has explicitly locked the table that is being altered.

A LOCK TABLE statement was issued in the current transaction to lock the
table that is being altered. An online alter fragment operation cannot be
performed in a transaction that has explicitly locked the table. If you
need to lock the table, perform the alter fragment operation offline.


-25844	Cannot create an interval fragmented temporary table or index.

Interval fragmentation is not supported with temporary tables and indexes.


-25845	An online operation is already in progress on this table.

The following online operations are possible on a table:
  - online create index
  - online drop index
  - online alter fragment
Only one of the above online operations can be performed on a table at a time.
Wait until the first online operation is complete before reissuing another
online command.


-25846	Cannot alter the fragmentation scheme online if replication is defined on the table.

The fragmentation scheme cannot be altered online if replication is defined
on the table. Reissue the statement without the ONLINE keyword.


-25847	The fragments of the table or index have changed.

The fragments of the table or index have changed before an exclusive lock
could be obtained on the table. Either an interval fragment was added during
some DML activity or an ALTER FRAGMENT ONLINE operation just completed.
This condition is normally transient, retry operation after some delay.


-25848	The functional key argument is invalid.

The error occurred due to one or more of the following reasons:

     The first argument to functional index needs to table column.
     If other arguments are constant, it needs to be string type of length
     less than 128 bytes.


-25849	The indexkey size exceeds the catalog column size.

The error occurred due to encoded indexkey size excceds the szie of 
sysindcies.indexkey column. If you used functional index with constants reduce
the size of the constant.


-25850	The window-frame extent specification requires a window-order clause.

Any window-frame extent specification also requires the window-order clause, 
unless the window frame is between UNBOUNDED PRECEDING and UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING.


-25851	The window-frame extent value specification are not correct.

If RANGE is specified, then the window-order clause in the window definition 
must contain a single sort key. The declared data type of the sort key can be 
numeric, DATETIME, or INTERVAL. The data type of the constant value
in <unsigned-constant > FOLLOWING or <unsigned-constant > PRECEDING
specifications must be a numeric if the sort key has a numeric data type.  
Otherwise, it must be an INTERVAL type that can be added to or subtracted 
from values of the declared type of the ORDER BY sort key.

If ROWS is specified, then the declared type of the <unsigned-constant >  
must be an exact numeric data type with a scale of 0 (zero), such as INTEGER.


-25852	The window-frame extent BETWEEN options are not valid.

The specified BETWEEN options that define the window-frame extent are not valid.

Use BETWEEN specifications that conform to the documented window-frame extent 
syntax in your GBase Guide to SQL:Syntax.  This is a subset of the 
BETWEEN syntax for OLAP windowed aggregates that the Cognos庐 product supports.


-25853	The ntile, lead, lag and ranking window functions require window order.

The aggregate RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), DENSERANK(), PERCENT_RANK(), LAG(), LEAD(),
CUME_DIST(), and NTILE() window functions require the window-order clause.


-25854	The  ntile, lead, lag, ranking and row numbering window functions cannot have a window-frame extent.

The ROWNUMBER(), ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), DENSERANK(), LAG(), LEAD(),
PERCENT_RANK(), CUME_DIST(), NTILE() window functions cannot be called if a
window-frame extent is also defined for the window.


-25855	The option specified is not supported in window aggregates.

The following options are not supported in OLAP window aggregates, including 
aggregates in the PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, and window-frame extent clauses:
     
     Window aggregates with user-defined aggregates
     Correlated subqueries 
     Collection subqeries
     Complex data types
     Cross server tables in the OLAP query
     CURRVAL or NEXTVAL expressions for sequence objects.


-25856	Invalid usage of window aggregate in this context.

You can use OLAP window aggregate functions in the Projection clause 
and in the ORDER BY clause of queries.  They cannot be present in 
the WHERE clause or in the HAVING clause (except within a subquery).


-25857	Invalid usage of DISTINCT aggregate in this context.

DISTINCT is only allowed for the following OLAP aggregate functions:

SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), RANGE(), VARIANCE(), STDEV()


-25858	DISTINCT aggregate can not have ORDER BY clause or window frame extent.

When DISTINCT is specified in OLAP aggregate functions the window function
cannot have ORDER BY clause or window frame extent.


-25859	The argument to NTILE window function is invalid.

The argument to NTILE window function needs to be positive non-zero 
numeric value.


-25860	The offset of the LEAD, LAG window function is invalid.

The argument of LEAD, LAG NTILE window function needs to be positive numeric
type with scale 0(zero).


-25861	The types of default expression and expression of LEAD, LAG are not compatible.

The default expression type shall be compaitble with LEAD, LAG window 
expression type.


-25862	The argument to RATIO_TO_REPORT window function is invalid.

The argument to RATIO_TO_REPORT window function needs to be of numeric data type.

-26000	Locks cannot be limited for a user who has administrative privileges.	

You cannot set the IFX_SESSION_LIMIT_LOCKS option to the SET ENVIRONMENT statement 
for a user who has administrative privileges, such as user gbasedbt or a DBSA user. 
Users with administrative privileges are always allowed to have the maximum allowed 
number of locks per session.

-26001	The encryption/decryption password is not set.

Provide an encryption password in the argument list to the
encryption/decryption functions or use the "SET ENCRYPTION PASSWORD" 
statement.

-26002	Invalid encryption password data type.

The encryption password is invalid because the specified password data 
type is not supported. Use a string type (such as CHAR(20) or 
VARCHAR(40)) for the encryption password.

-26003	The data must be encrypted with a password length between 6 
and 128.

The encryption password is invalid because the length of the specified
password was less than 6 bytes or greater than 128 bytes.

-26004	The encryption hint data type is not supported.

Use a string type (such as CHAR(20) or VARCHAR(40)) for the 
encryption hint.

-26005	The encrypted data is wrong or corrupted.

The data must be a result of an IDS encryption function. The decryption 
may have failed because the data was not encrypted, was corrupted, or 
truncated (e.g. ALTER TABLE operation) since encryption, or was 
encrypted with an algorithm not supported by this version.

-26006	The data type is not supported for encryption functions.

BYTE/TEXT and UDT are not supported. Use BLOB/CLOB instead of BYTE/TEXT, 
or cast a UDT to a string type such as CHAR or LVARCHAR.

-26007	The internal encryption function failed.

The internal crypto library encryption API failed. 

-26008	The internal decryption function failed.

The internal crypto library decryption API failed. This error may be 
caused by a wrong password or corrupted data.

-26009	Key generation failed.

The internal crypto library key generation API failed.

-26010	Random IV generation failed.

The internal crypto library random API failed to generate an 
initialization vector (IV).

-26011	The internal base64 encoding function failed.

The internal crypto library base64 encoding API failed.

-26012	The internal base64 decoding function failed.

The internal crypto library base64 decoding API failed.

-26100	You cannot set the GRANT ACCESS or REVOKE ACCESS properties when the
USERMAPPING onconfig parameter is OFF

The GRANT ACCESS and REVOKE ACCESS statements can only be used if the ONCONFIG
parameter USERMAPPING is ON.


-26101	The specified group name (%s) does not exist.

The group name specified was not found in the operating system's group
database.  When you specify a surrogate group by name, the surrogate name must
exist in in the operating system's group database (/etc/group file or
equivalent).

ACTION
Either ask the operating system administrator to add the group or change the
statement to reference a group name that does exist.


-26102	The specified user name (%s) does not exist.

The user name specified was not found in the operating system's user database.
When you specify the surrogate user by name, the surrogate name must exist in
in the operating system's user database (/etc/passwd file or equivalent).

ACTION
Either ask the operating system administrator to add the user or change the
statement to reference a user name that does exist.


-26103	You cannot modify existing access for user %s now.  You must revoke access
first then grant access.

The named user has already been granted access.  To alter a user's access, you
must first revoke their existing access rights with REVOKE ACCESS and then
grant the new rights with GRANT ACCESS.


-26104	Reserved for future use.

This message is not currently used.


-26105	You should specify a group for the user.

You must specify at least one group for the mapped user using a group name or
group number.


-26106	You specified more than %d group names or numbers.

You specified more group names or group numbers than the system permits.


-26107	User name (%s) has already been granted access.

The named user has already been granted access.  If you need to change their
access, you must revoke access before granting the altered access.


-26108	You cannot grant root or gbasedbt user privilege to the user.

The GRANT ACCESS command listed either one of the user names root or gbasedbt,
or the user numbers corresponding to those names.  You cannot grant a mapped
user the privileges of a surrogate user equivalent to either user root or
gbasedbt.


-26109	You cannot grant access to user gbasedbt or root.

The users gbasedbt and root cannot be treated as mapped users; they must
both be regular unmapped users known to the operating system.


-26110	The specified group has administrative privileges.  You must either specify
userauth properties or not include the group in the GRANT ACCESS statement.

One of the groups identified in the group clause is an administrative group
(the DBSA, DBSSO, AAO group or bargroup) but the user was not identified as
belonging to the group with the userauth properties clause.  You cannot
accidentally grant a user administrative privileges by listing the group name
or group number; you must do so explicitly.


-26111	The specified userauth (%s) property does not exist.  The valid values
-are dbsa, dbsso, dbaao or bargroup.

You specified an administrative property in the userauth clause that is not
recognized.  You may only use one of the values listed.

-26811	Can not create temp table with replcheck columns

It is not possible to create a temp table with REPLCHECK columns

-26812	Illegal usage of REPLCHECK columns

You can not directly update REPLCHECK columns

-26813	Can not add REPLCHECK when the table already has REPLCHECK columns

The table already has REPLCHECK columns.

-26814	Can not drop REPLCHECK when table does not have REPLCHECK columns

The table that you were attempting to alter does not have REPLCHECK columns.

-26815	Can not perform this operation on a table with REPLCHECK columns

The operation that you attempted to perform can not be executed on a table containing REPLCHECK columns.



-26910	The statement failed because it referenced a rolling window table. 

The REFERENCES clause in a FOREIGN KEY definition cannot specify a
rolling window table.

-26911	The statement failed because each constraint on a rolling
window table requires a supporting index.

You cannot add a PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY or UNIQUE constraint on a
rolling window table unless an index on the table has the same RANGE
INTERVAL fragmentation strategy as the table.

Explicitly create an index on the table (with no storage option for
the index) before you add the PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, or UNIQUE
constraint.

-26912	The statement failed because rowids are not allowed with
rolling window tables.

Use the ALTER TABLE statement to remove the ROWID column and then
define a RANGE INTERVAL fragmentation strategy with a purge policy
clause.

-26913	Cannot enable a rolling window because the table is
referenced by other tables.

The table Ccannot be a rolling window table because it is referenced
by an enabled FOREIGN KEY constraint on another table. Drop or disable
that referential constraint, or else change your storage management
strategy for the table. 

-26914	The index was not created, because its storage differs from
that of its rolling window table.

Rolling window tables require a RANGE INTERVAL fragmentation strategy.
The database server automatically applies the same storage strategy
to each index that is subsequently defined on the table, but it
returns this error if any storage option is specified for the index,
or if the ALTER FRAGMENT statement references an index on a rolling
window table. 

To create an index on a rolling window table, use the CREATE INDEX
statement with no storage option.

-26915	The statement failed because the ROLLING FRAGMENTS and LIMIT TO
clauses require positive integers. 

In the CREATE TABLE and ALTER FRAGMENT MODIFY statements, make sure that
iny literal value or expressio immediately following the ROLLING keyword
or the LIMIT TO keywords evaluates to a positive integer. 

-26916	The statement failed because the new table size would exceed the
threshold set by the LIMIT TO clause.

The table referenced in this statement has a maximum storage size limit.
This statement would allocate more storage space for range fragments and index
fragments than is allowed.  No space would be available for new interval
fragments.
You can increase the maximum table size by using the LIMIT TO clause.
Otherwise, if the CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX statement failed, specify a
lower EXTENT SIZE value.

-26917	The statement failed because a UDR specifies the dbspace for the next
interval fragment of this table or index. 

You cannot change th elist of dbspaces for interval fragments when a UDR returns
the dbspace names for storing new interval fragments. You can use the STORE IN
clause of the ALTER FRAGMENT MODIFY statement to replace the user-defined function
with a list of dbspaces in which to create system-generated interval fragments.

-27000	Cannot support multiple connections over shared memory.

An application cannot use the CONNECT statement to make more than one
connection that uses shared-memory communication (IPC).

Ensure that the application makes only one shared-memory connection at
a time. If the application must use concurrent connections, the
database server administrator might need to change the connection type
(as specified in the nettype field of the sqlhosts file) from a shared
-memory connection to a network connection.


-27001	Read error occurred during connection attempt.

This error can occur on either the client or database server side.

When you encounter this error on the client side, it indicates that a
network I/O error occurred when the client tried to connect to a
database server. Probably the connection attempt timed out because the
database server or the network was very busy, too many clients were
attempting to connect to the database server simultaneously, or the
database server was taken off-line during the connection attempt.

If you are using GBase Database Server, GBase Database Server,
or GBase Database Server, verify that the database server is
still online. If you are using GBase SE, verify that the sqlexecd daemon
for the database server is still running. Use either or both of the environment
variables GBASEDBTCONTIME and GBASEDBTCONRETRY on the client side to increase
the connection time and number of retry attempts.

When you encounter this error on the database server side, it is a
warning that a network I/O error is detected while the database server
is accepting a connection request from a client. This error usually
occurs when the database server or the network is very busy or when too
many clients are trying to connect to the database server at once. The
database server might be taking so long to respond to a client that the
client's connection request timed out before the connection is
complete. Or possibly a client terminated its connection attempt before
the connection is completely established.

If this error is seen only occasionally in the server message log, it
is just a warning. No corrective action is required on the server
side.

If this error occurs frequently on a database server that runs on a
host with multiple processors, you might want to tune the database
server by increasing the number of poll threads and/or listener
threads.


-27002	No connections are allowed in quiescent mode.

You are attempting to connect to a database server that is in quiescent
mode. Verify that your GBASEDBTSERVER environment variable is set
correctly. Ask the database server administrator to bring the
appropriate database servers to online mode.


-27003	Internal Communications Error: internal inconsistency detected.

The GBase client/server communication system has detected an
internal inconsistency. Typically, a client application reports this
error. This error might be a memory-corruption error due to a
programming bug. If the database server or a utility reported the
error, it is an GBase internal error. When an GBase internal
error occurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-27004	Illegal sqlhosts file option/parameter, parameter, for dbservername,
servername.

You specified an invalid option or parameter in your sqlhosts file.
Check the option ID and parameter associated with servername in the
sqlhosts file.

Linux,UNIX: If you use either the IPC stream pipe (onipcstr) protocol or the 
IPC shared memory (onipcshm) protocol, ensure that the communications file 
directory (cfd option) is shorter than or equal to 70 bytes. If the directory 
is a relative path, the length includes the $GBASEDBTDIR directory.

-27005	Illegal sqlexecd daemon option, option_value.

You specified an invalid sqlexecd daemon option. Check the option
option_value and its parameter.


-27006	Network driver cannot establish listen endpoint.

You specified stream pipe (ipcstr) as the network-communication type
for this database server. The database server is not able to create the
stream pipe. The most common cause of this error is that another
database server on your network is already using the service name for
this database server.

Check that the servicename value in the $GBASEDBTDIR/etc/sqlhosts file or
in the SQLHOSTS registry information is unique across all database servers
on your network. If the servicename is unique, check the accompanying ISAM
code for additional error information.

If a previously created stream pipe with the same name is not released
by an aborted online server, you need to manually remove the stream
pipe files /GBASEDBTTMP/<servicename>.str and /GBASEDBTTMP/<servicename>.exp.


-27007	Invalid file descriptor opened for the user thread.

An internal GBase network error has occurred in the TLITCP poll
thread. Note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-27010	Only an administrative user can connect in administrative user mode.

The database server is in administrative user mode. You must set the 
ADMIN_USER_MODE_WITH_DBSA parameter to '1' to allow any administrative user 
to connect. If the ADMIN_USER_MODE_WITH_DBSA parameter is set to '0', then 
only user "gbasedbt" or the non-root server owner can connect.

-27009	Connection to HDR secondary not allowed using group name

Your GBASEDBTSERVER setting specifies a group entry for an HDR pair.
HDR primary server is currently not available, and HDR secondary server
is still in secondary mode.
To connect to HDR secondary server in read-only mode, set GBASEDBTSERVER
to the explicit DBSERVERNAME of the secondary server.
To be able to process transactions, either bring up your HDR primary server,
or convert your HDR seconadry server to standard mode.


-27100	Internal Communications Error: NSF subsystem error.

This error message can appear if there is an internal NSF subsystem failure.

-28014	Secure Sockets Layer error.

An error occurred during a Secure Socket Layer operation. For more information,
refer to the accompanying GBASE Global Security Kit (GSKit) error message.


-28015	Secure Sockets Layer configuration error.

An error occurred while reading the Secure Sockets Layer configuration
file (conssl.cfg).


-28016	GBASE Global Security Kit (GSKit) <version> or higher is not installed.

The GBASE Global Security Kit (GSKit) is either not installed or the version
that is installed is too old. The GSKit provides APIs for the Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) communication and encryption functionality. If you want to set up
SSL connections or use encryption functionality, you must install the GSKit.
For instructions on installing GSKit, refer to the $GBASEDBTDIR/gskit/README 
file.

-28021	A trusted connection was not established because a trusted context is
not defined or not enabled for the specified authorization ID.

Ensure that the trusted context is correctly defined and enabled, and then
establish a trusted connection.

-28022	A trusted connection was not established because the encryption
requirement for the connection was not met.

Ensure that the encryption requirement for the trusted context is correctly
defined and that the port is correctly encrypted.

-29000	Application server error (server_error_number).

A generic application-server error occurred. Examine the original
foreign SQLCODE. You can find it in either SQLERRD[1] or as part of
SQLERRM. Look up the explanation for this SQLCODE in the documentation
for the foreign server product. Apply the tokens, if any, that are
returned in the SQLERRM field to the explanation.


-29002	Supplied real-RDB-name does not match the real-RDB-name in sqlhosts.

A mismatch was detected between the user-supplied real-RDB-name and the
real-RDB-name that was derived from the user-supplied alias-RDB-name
using the sqlhosts file.

Check the spelling of the user-supplied real-RDB-name. Ensure that the
user-supplied alias-RDB-name is the correct one.

If SNA network protocol is used to connect to the application server,
check the real-RDB-name column (the "hostname" field) in the "sqlhosts" file
for the alias-RDB-name entry, and check that it is spelled correctly.

If TCP/IP network protocol is used to connect to the application server,
check the "RDB=real-RDB-name" option (in the "options" field) in the 
"sqlhosts" file for the alias-RDB-name entry, and check that it is 
spelled correctly.


-29003	RDB real-RDB-name not found at the application server.

Although a communication conversation was allocated, the application
server refused to connect because it has a real-RDB-name that is different
from that to which the application would like to connect.

Examine the sqlhosts file on the Gateway computer. Identify the entry
with the alias-RDB-name to which the application is referring.

If SNA network protocol is used to connect to the application server,
ensure that the "hostname" field contains a correct value.

If TCP/IP network protocol is used to connect to the application server,
ensure that the "RDB=real-RDB-name" option in the "options" field 
contains a correct value.


-29004	DRDA protocol error. ReplyMsg[,sub-code]:
ReplyMessage-codepoint[,sub-code].

A DRDA protocol error prevents the successful execution of the current
SQL statement. This error will not affect the successful execution of
subsequent SQL statements.

A DRDA internal Distributed Data Management (DDM) reply message (RM)
was received from the application server. That message indicates that
an error has occurred. The application server or possibly the
application requestor (AR) detected an error.

A hexadecimal codepoint and possibly a hexadecimal sub-code are
returned as a token in SQLERRM.

To interpret the hexadecimal codepoint and the hexadecimal sub-code,
you need DDM knowledge.

The hexadecimal codepoint is the 2-byte hexadecimal codepoint for the
DDM reply message that represents the error and is one of the
following:

    *   X'220A' -- DSCINVRM

    *   X'124C' -- SYNTAXRM

    *   X'1245' -- PRCCNVRM

    *   X'1254' -- CMDCHKRM

    *   X'220E' -- DTAMCHRM

    *   X'2202' -- QRYNOPRM

    *   X'220F' -- QRYPOPRM

    *   X'2207' -- RDBACCRM

    *   X'2204' -- RDBNACRM

The first three reason codes (DSCINVRM, SYNTAXRM, and PRCCNVRM)
accompany a 2-byte hexadecimal sub-code. In all other cases, the
sub-code is zero.

When nonzero, the high-order byte of the sub-code indicates the site at
which the error was detected. If the AR detects the error, it is X'01.
If the application server detects the error, it is X'02'. The
lower-order byte is as follows:

    *   Description Error Code (DSCERRCD) if reason code = DSCINVRM

    *   Syntax Error Code (SYNERRCD) if reason code = SYNTAXRM

    *   Conversational Protocol Error Code (PRCCVNCD) if reason code =
	PRCCNVRM

Contact the DBA for assistance in analyzing the SQL statement that
yielded this SQLCODE. If the error recurs, note all
circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-29005	Hard DRDA protocol error. ReplyMsg[,sub-code]:
ReplyMessage-codepoint[,sub-code].

A DRDA protocol error caused deallocation of the conversation.

A DRDA internal Distributed Data Management (DDM) reply message (RM)
was received from the application server. The message indicates that an
error has occurred. The application server or possibly the application
requestor (AR) detected an error.

A hexadecimal codepoint and possibly a hexadecimal sub-code are
returned as a token in SQLERRM.

To interpret the hexadecimal codepoint and the hexadecimal sub-code
requires DDM knowledge.

The hexadecimal codepoint is the 2-byte hexadecimal codepoint for the
DDM reply message that represents the error and is one of the
following:

    *   X'220A' -- DSCINVRM

    *   X'124C' -- SYNTAXRM

    *   X'1245' -- PRCCNVRM

    *   X'1218' -- MGRDEPRM

    *   X'1232' -- AGNPRMRM

    *   X'1254' -- CMDCHKRM

    *   X'220E' -- DTAMCHRM

    *   X'2202' -- QRYNOPRM

    *   X'220F' -- QRYPOPRM

    *   X'2207' -- RDBACCRM

    *   X'2204' -- RDBNACRM

A 2-byte hexadecimal sub-code is accompanied with the first four reason
codes (DSCINVRM, SYNTAXRM, PRCCNVRM, and MGRDEPRM). In all other cases,
the sub-code is zero.

When nonzero, the high-order byte of the sub-code indicates the site at
which the error was detected. If the AR detects the error, it is X'01.
If the application server detects the error, it is X'02'. The
lower-order byte is as follows:

    *   Description Error Code (DSCERRCD) if reason code = DSCINVRM

    *   Syntax Error Code (SYNERRCD) if reason code = SYNTAXRM

    *   Conversational Protocol Error Code (PRCCVNCD) if reason code =
	PRCCNVRM

    *   Manager Dependency Error Code (DEPERRCD) if reason code =
	MGRDEPRM

Notify the DBA for assistance in analyzing the SQL statement that
yielded this SQLCODE. If the error recurs, note all
circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-29006	DRDA connect protocol error. Manager,level: (manager,level) not
supported.

The connect process failed.

The application server cannot support a DRDA manager level that was 
requested by the AR (application requester) during the DRDA connection 
process.

The hexadecimal codepoint of the manager (MGRLVL) and the hexadecimal
codepoint of the level requested are returned as a token in SQLERRM.

Attempt to connect to the application server again. If the problem
persists, notify the DBA for assistance. If the error recurs,
note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-29007	RDB authorization failure. RDB-userID,RDB: RDB-userID,RDB-name.

of the current SQL statement is terminated. The application is
disconnected from the application server.

The SQLERRM contains the hex DDM codepoint of the object type in
question.

Attempt to run the application again. If the problem persists, notify
the DBA for assistance in analyzing the SQL statement that yielded this
SQLCODE. If the error recurs, note all circumstances and contact
GBase Technical Support.


-29030	Feature feature-name not supported by the Gateway.

The Gateway product does not support this feature. (For example, it
does not support GBase-specific SQL statements or GBase-specific
data types.) The feature that is not supported is returned as a token
in SQLERRM.

Correct the application and do not use any feature that the Gateway
cannot support on SQL statements that will go through the Gateway
during execution.


-29031	Table or view name objname has an invalid format

The Add-table and Purge-table options of the gwdba utility for adding
and purging tables and views from the GBase catalog on an
application server require a file of table and view names as input. The
listed table or view name (objname) has an invalid format. The format
of table and view names in the file must be in the following format:

owner.tabname


-29032	Application Server CCSIDs could not be determined.

The Gateway is required to perform outbound character code-set
conversion for this client operating-system locale, but the Gateway
could not determine the CCSIDs of the application server.

Notify the administrator of the Gateway. The administrator must set the
GWASCCSID environment variable to match the single-byte CCSID of the
application server. If network mode is being used, the Gateway
administrator must stop and restart the Gateway daemon after setting
the GWASCCSID environment variable. The Gateway administrator must then
connect to the application server using either a CONNECT statement or a
DATABASE statement. This connection captures all the CCSIDs in the
cache file $GBASEDBTDIR/gw/sysinfo/prnccsid.dat.


-29033	GBase GLS locale could not be loaded: localename, errno,
locale-file-name.

localename        The name of the GBase GLS locale that could not be
                  loaded. The value for localename must be of the format
                  language_territory.codeset.

errno             A number that indicates the specific reason that the
                  GBase GLS locale could not be loaded.

locale-file-name  The subdirectory and filename (for example, /en_US/0333.lco)
                  of the GBase GLS locale file that could not be loaded.

language          A two-letter lowercase abbreviation for the language name.

territory         A two-letter uppercase abbreviation for the territory name.

codeset           The name of the character code set for the locale.

Valid values for the codeset field are registered in the
$GBASEDBTDIR/gls/cm/REGISTRY file. The values are character strings
that describe the code set. However, if a codeset field value is an
integer in the range from 1 to 65,535, it is an acceptable value even
if it is not in the REGISTRY file.

An attempt to load the GBase GLS locale that localename specified
failed for the reason that errno indicates, as follows:

6-   The locale specification localename is in a bad format.

    The Gateway administrator must correct this specification.

7-   The locale file that locale-file-name specified does not exist.

    If the appropriate directory (see the following paragraph) does not
    contain the locale file that the subdirectory and filename that
    locale-file-name specified, this GBase GLS locale is not available.
    Read your GBase product documentation to ensure that you specified
    the GBase GLS localename correctly (using environment variables or
    other mechanisms that the documentation describes). The GBase GLS
    localename might be incorrectly specified or might be equivalent to
    another GBase GLS locale that is available.

    If the subdirectory and filename that locale-file-name specified exist,
    verify that your product was installed correctly so that the GBase
    GLS locale file can be located. Specifically, ensure that the GL_PATH
    environment variable is set (or not set) according to the Gateway
    installation instructions:

    *   If GL_PATH is not set, verify that the subdirectory and file
        that locale-file-name specifies are in the $GBASEDBTDIR/gls/lc
        directory.

    *   If GL_PATH is set, verify that the subdirectory and filename
        that locale-file-name specifies are in one of the directories
        that the GL_PATH environment variable specifies.

10-  The locale file that locale-file-name specified is not a locale file.

    The locale file that locale-file-name specified is not an GBase GLS
    locale file, or it has been corrupted. Check that you are using the
    locale file that your GBase product supplier provided. Refresh the
    file from the original installation file if it has been corrupted.

11-  The locale object is inconsistent.

    The locale object is not consistent. For example, the same code set is
    not being used in each locale category. Contact your GBase product
    supplier for assistance.

For any other errno value, contact your GBase product supplier for
assistance.


-29034	Character code-set conversion error. Tokens: from-cs-num, to-cs-num,
cftype, objtype, position.

The character code-set conversion failed while converting a character
string from the code set that from-cs-num identifies to the code set
that to-cs-num identifies.

cftype       The conversion failure type.

from_cs_num  The code-set number for the input code set. Check your GBase
             product documentation for a description of the code set that this
             code-set number identifies.

objtype      The type of object that is being converted.

position     The ordinal position of the value that is being converted.

to_cs_num    The code-set number for the output code set. Check your GBase
             product documentation for a description of the code set that
             this code-set number identifies.

The following are the possible cftype values:

    *   If cftype is "unmapped input char" (cpstring), the input
        character did not exist in the output code set, and the
        conversion table did not define a substitute output character
        for the input character. The cpstring value shows the input
        character string for a length of up to 4 bytes, starting with
        the codepoint that could not be converted. The binary value of
        the codepoint bytes is represented by cpstring as a
        hexadecimal string (for example, 'c1c3d1f0').

        This failure type has two possible causes:

        1.  The character data that is being converted is bad. Correct
            the character data that is being converted.

        2.  The code-set conversion table is incorrect or incomplete.
            Contact your GBase software distributor for assistance.

    *   If cftype is "bad form," the input character string was badly
        formed with respect to the shift-out and shift-in codepoints
        that delimit the internal code sets that are contained within
        the code set that code-set number from_cs_num identifies.

        For this failure type, correct the form of character data that is
        being converted.

    *   If cftype is "too long," the length of the output string was
        longer than the internal buffers that are allocated to hold the
        output string. If the objtype is "output," the output value was
        longer than the maximum length of a CHAR data type.

        For this failure type, shorten the input character data that is
        being converted.

The following are the possible objtype values:

    *   If objtype is "input," an input value from the application,
        such as an SQL statement or an input host variable value, was
        being converted.

    *   If objtype is "output," an output value from the database, such
        as a field or expression from the select list of a SELECT
        statement, was being converted.

    *   If objtype is "sqlda," an sqlname field in the output SQLDA was
        being converted.

    *   If objtype is "sqlca," a character field in the SQLCA was being
        converted.

The following possible meanings of position depend on the value of
objtype:

    *   If objtype is "input" and position is 0, the text of the input
        SQL statement could not be converted.

    *   If objtype is "input" and position is not 0, position refers to
        the ordinal position of the input host variable value that
        could not be converted. For example, 2 means that the value of
        the second input host variable could not be converted.

    *   If objtype is "output" and position is any value, position is
        the ordinal position of the output value that could not be
        converted, such as the third value in the select list of a
        SELECT statement.

    *   If objtype is "sqlda" and position is any value, position is
        the ordinal position of the sqlname field in the SQLDA that
        could not be converted.

    *   If objtype is "sqlca," position names the specific SQLCA field
        that could not be converted: sqlerrp, sqlwarn, sqlerrmc, or
        sqlstate.


-29035	An incompatible data type was received by the Gateway.

The received data type is not compatible with or supported by the Gateway.
(For GBase Enterprise Gateway with DRDA, the application requestor does
not support the data type that was received from the application server.)

Some examples of unsupported data types are 1-byte integer and 16-byte
float. These data types are not supported.

Do not retrieve data from the columns that have data types that the
Gateway cannot support.


-29036	Character codeset conversion file not found from, to, filename:
from_cs_num, to_cs_num, filename.

filename     The filename of the code-set conversion file that could not be
             found.

from_cs_num  The code-set number for the source code set.

to_cs_num    The code-set number for the target code set.

A code-set conversion table to convert from the code set that
from_cs_num identifies to the code set that to_cs_num identifies was
not found. Consult your GBase product documentation to find
descriptions for the code sets that these code-set numbers identify.

If the appropriate directory (see next paragraph) does not contain the
code-set conversion file named filename, this code-set conversion
cannot be performed. Check your GBase product documentation to make
sure that the code sets that the client and server products use have
been specified correctly (using environment variables or other
mechanisms that are described in the documentation). Perhaps the
code-set numbers have been incorrectly specified or are equivalent to
other code-set numbers that are supported.

If the code-set conversion table exists, verify that your product was
installed correctly so that the conversion table file can be located.
Specifically, ensure that the GL_PATH environment variable is set or
not set according to the installation instructions.

    *   If GL_PATH is not set, verify that the conversion table file is
        in the $GBASEDBTDIR/gls/cv directory.

    *   If GL_PATH is set, verify that the conversion table file is in
	one of the directories that the GL_PATH environment variable
	specifies.

If the code-set conversion table does not exist, contact your GBase
software distributor for assistance in determining what code-set
conversion tables are required for your configuration. If the required
code-set conversion tables are available, place the tables in the
appropriate directory.


-29037	There is no CCSID or GLS locale set for the FE OS locale localename.

The locale in question is returned as a token in SQLERRM.

Notify the Gateway administrator. The administrator can add an entry
for the locale using the gwdba utility.


-29039	Cannot have more than one SQL statement in PREPARE/EXECUTE IMMEDIATE.

Modify the application so that it does not include more than one SQL
statement in a PREPARE or EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement.


-29040	Cannot translate MATCHES pattern to LIKE pattern.

The Gateway does not support and cannot translate one or more
characters in the MATCHES condition of your SQL statement. Try to
rewrite the statement to use LIKE instead of MATCHES condition syntax
or to not include MATCHES wildcard characters such as [ ] and ? or *.
Check also that you did not try to include a non-CHAR or VARCHAR column
with MATCHES in the WHERE clause.


-29042	Package info for RDB rdbname not found. Use gwdba to bind.

The Gateway package information for the target RDB is not found. It
appears that the necessary Gateway packages on the RDB have not been
bound yet. The real_RDB_name of the target RDB is returned as a token
in SQLERRM.

The end user should contact the DBA. If desirable, the DBA can use the
gwdba utility to bind the needed Gateway packages on the target RDB.


-29043	No more section-type sections left. Rebind Gateway packages with more
sections.

All the available sections in the current package at the application
server have been used up. The current SQL statement is terminated.

Notify the DBA. The DBA can rebind the Gateway packages with more
sections on the target RDB using the gwdba utility.


-29044	Gateway internal logic error [diagnostic-error-string].

An internal logic error has been encountered. Rerun the application. If
the error recurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical
Support.


-29045	Gateway internal logic error [diagnostic-error-string].  Disconnected
from AS.

An internal logic error has been encountered. This error will cause
deallocation of conversation.

Rerun the application. If the error recurs, note all
circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-29046	SNA buffer size (size) is not valid.

The send buffer that the GBase connectivity network module allocated
is less than the minimum DRDA required size, which is 512 bytes, or
more than the maximum size, which is 32,767 bytes.

Check the sqlhosts file on the Gateway computer. If the send buffer size
is configurable through the sqlhosts file, make sure that the send
buffer size is configured to be from 512 bytes to 32,767 bytes,
inclusive.


-29048	ISAM Error: error message.

An ISAM error occurred while reading data from a Gateway ISAM setup
file that the Gateway xxxdba utility manages. The name of the ISAM
setup file in question and the ISAM error number are returned in
SQLERRM.

If the Gateway was spawned by way of IPC-pipe mode, you must ensure
that the GBASEDBTDIR environment variable was set correctly before the
application starts. Otherwise, notify the DBA:

    *   The DBA for GBase Enterprise Gateway must ensure that the
        $GBASEDBTDIR/egw/sysinfo directory exists with the proper
        permissions and that the ISAM setup files are present in 
        that directory. If an GBase Enterprise Gateway setup 
        file is missing or corrupted, run egwdba to create it, or
        run the bcheckegw utility to repair it.

If GBase Enterprise Gateway was spawned by way of network mode (that
is, by the daemon egwd), the DBA also must ensure that the GBASEDBTDIR
environment variable was set correctly in the root login when the egwd
daemon was started.

    *   The DBA for GBase Gateway with DRDA must ensure that the
        $GBASEDBTDIR/gw/sysinfo directory exists with the proper
        permissions and the ISAM setup files are present in that
        directory. If a Gateway setup file is missing or corrupted,
        run gwdba to create it, or run the bcheckgw utility to repair 
        it.

If the Gateway was spawned by way of network mode (that is, by the
daemon gwd), the GBase Gateway with DRDA DBA also must ensure that
the GBASEDBTDIR environment variable was set correctly in the root
login when the gwd daemon was started.

    *   The DBA for GBase Enterprise Gateway Manager must ensure that the
        $GBASEDBTDIR/egm/sysinfo directory exists with the proper
        permissions and the ISAM setup files are present in that
        directory. If a Gateway setup file is missing or corrupted,
        run egmdba to create it, or run the bcheckegm utility to repair 
        it.

If the Gateway was spawned by way of network mode (that is, by the
daemon egmd), the GBase Enterprise Gateway Manager DBA also must ensure
that the GBASEDBTDIR environment variable was set correctly in the root
login when the egmd daemon was started.


-29049	Unable to locate/open Gateway setup file filename.

If you are using IPC-pipe mode to start the Gateway process, you should
ensure that the GBASEDBTDIR environment variable was set correctly
before the application starts.

*   For GBase Enterprise Gateway with DRDA:

An error occurred while locating or opening a Gateway ISAM setup file
that the gwdba utility manages. The name of the ISAM setup file that is
causing the error is returned in SQLERRM.

If you are using network connections, the GBase Enterprise Gateway with
DRDA database administrator must ensure that the named file exists in the
$GBASEDBTDIR/gw/sysinfo directory. If the file is missing, run gwdba to
create it. The DBA also must ensure that the GBASEDBTDIR environment
variable was set correctly at the time that the gwd daemon was
started.

*   For GBase Enterprise Gateway:

An error occurred while locating or opening an GBase Enterprise Gateway
ISAM setup file that the egwdba utility manages. The name of the ISAM setup
file that is causing the error is returned in SQLERRM.

If you are using network connections, the GBase Enterprise Gateway
DBA must ensure that the named file exists in the
$GBASEDBTDIR/egw/sysinfo directory. If the file is missing, run egwdba
to create it. The DBA also must ensure that the GBASEDBTDIR environment
variable was set correctly at the time that the egwd daemon was
started.

*   For GBase Enterprise Gateway Manager:

An error occurred while locating or opening a Gateway ISAM setup 
file that the egmdba utility manages. The name of the ISAM setup
file that is causing the error is returned in SQLERRM.

If you are using network connections, the GBase Enterprise Gateway
Manager database administrator must ensure that the named file
exists in the "$GBASEDBTDIR/egm/sysinfo" directory. If the file is
missing, run "egmdba" to create it. The DBA also must ensure that
the GBASEDBTDIR environment variable  was set correctly at the time
that the "egmd" daemon was started.


-29050	Error accessing schema information
(Orig-Msg[Sub=Sub-code,Ifx=Orig-code,Obj=Object-name])

The Gateway encountered an error while accessing catalog information
for the object Object-name. The Gateway sends this catalog information
to the coordinating database server while processing a distributed
query.

Several errors that might occur during catalog access can cause this
message. Orig-code is the error code for the underlying error, and
Orig-Msg is the message token that is associated with that error code.
Sub-code is an GBase internal code in hexadecimal that indicates
which catalog access query failed and in which stage of query
processing it failed. This diagnostic information field is meant for
Technical Support.

Although the error message token might be truncated through
programmatic access, the entire message is logged in the Gateway log
file gw.log in the directory $GBASEDBTDIR/gw/log.


-29051	Only single-site updates allowed in a transaction.

This Gateway does not support two-phase commit. If any remote server
that the Gateway accesses is an update site in a transaction, that site
must be the only update site in the transaction. All other sites,
including GBase sites, must be read only. Change the application to
update only one remote site per transaction. (However, if the sites in
a transaction are all read only, any number of sites can be updated in
the same transaction).

This error message applies only when the database server that
coordinates the transaction either is earlier than Version 7.2 or is
Version 7.2 or later and the HETERO_COMMIT configuration parameter is
not set.


-29052	Gateway cannot access the remote data source named data-source-name.

The token data-source-name has been used in a four-part object name.
For example:

data-source-name@gwservername:own1.tab1

In addition, the gwservername in the previous example has been used
earlier in your application in association with a different
data-source-name. For example, it might have been used with
data-source-name2:

data-source-name2@gwservername:own2.tab2

Within a single application, until a CLOSE DATABASE statement executes,
each gwservername can be used to access only one data-source-name.

To access more than one data-source-name within a single application,
you must start a separate Gateway daemon (with a unique gwservername)
for each remote data source. Then change your application so that each
unique gwservername in your application is always used in association
with the same data-source-name. For example, the following statements
consistently associate data-source-name dsn1 with gwservername gw1, and
dsn2 with gw2:

SELECT col5 FROM dsn1@gw1:own1.tab1 WHERE col1 > 100;

SELECT col2 FROM dsn2@gw2:own2.tab2 WHERE col4 < 10;

SELECT a.col1, b.col2 FROM dsn1@gw1:own3.tab3 a, dsn2@gw2:own4.tab4 b
        WHERE a.col2 = b.col3;

The token data-source-name in the error message has different meanings,
depending on the Gateway product:

    *   For GBase Enterprise Gateway Manager, data-source-name
	refers to the ODBC data-source name.

    *   For GBase Gateway with DRDA, data-source-name refers to the
	alias-RDB-name. Each Gateway instance can connect to only one
	RDB (application server).

    *   For GBase Enterprise Gateway, data-source-name refers to the
	EDA-Server-name. Each Gateway instance can connect to only one
	remote server.


-29053	Collection missing in the reference to object Object.

Any distributed query that references an OS/400 object must specify the
OS/400 collection or library to which the object belongs. The
collection or library name should be specified in the owner field of
the complete object name database@dbservername:owner.object. The
collection or library name is required to get catalog information for
the specified Object in a given collection or library.


-29055	DDL statements are not allowed on a remote object.

In a distributed query, the Gateway does not allow data definition
statements and the data access statements GRANT and REVOKE on remote
objects (such as objects at DRDA application server sites).
Applications can use these statements only when they use the Gateway in
direct mode.


-29056	Gateway cannot rollback savepoint (error-message-info).

An error occurred while a remote distributed update was in progress.
Because the Gateway cannot undo the effects of the partial update, the
application must terminate the current transaction with a ROLLBACK WORK
statement. Any other statement in the current transaction will fail
with this error code. If the application issues a COMMIT WORK
statement, a ROLLBACK WORK statement is executed internally, and this
error code is returned.

The error-message-info field contains the sqlcode of the original error
and an optional error messages string if the error originated at the
target data source. The format of this message string is documented in
the appropriate Gateway user manual. If the error-message-info field is
empty, the savepoint rollback is the result of a processing error at
the coordinating database server.


-29057	Gateway does not support remote aliases (remote-object-name).

The Gateway does not support access to DB2 remote aliases in
distributed queries. A remote alias is defined for an object that is
not on the same server where the alias is defined.

Remote-object-name is the three-part object name (in the format
LOCATION.OWNER.OBJECT) to which the remote alias refers.


-29060	EDA error (EDA_Error).

The SQL statement failed because of an EDA error. EDA_Error describes
the EDA error that the EDA client or server returned.

The format of the EDA_Error field is as follows:

[EDA_Error_Code EDA_command] EDA_message_text

    *   EDA_Error_Code is the EDA numeric error code.

    *   EDA_command is the EDA API/SQL command that is issuing the
        error.

    *   EDA_message_text is the EDA message text that is associated
	with the error.

Look up the error in your EDA documentation from Information Builders,
Inc. and correct the problem.


-29062	An EDA Client or Server prompt was received.

The EDA client or server has prompted the Gateway to respond to a
message. For example, an EDA Remote Procedure might prompt the user
for input. The Gateway does not support EDA operations that require
responses to prompt messages.


-29063	Output data description changed between prepare and execute.

The description of the output data for the query that was returned at
prepare time is different than the description that was returned at
execute time. The description of the output data that was returned at
prepare time is derived from the cataloged information about the
objects (for example, tables or remote procedures) in the query. This
error usually occurs because the cataloged information about the object
is out of date.

If the object is not cataloged, or if it has changed since it was last
cataloged, the object must be cataloged (or recataloged) with the
EDASAF or EDA/SQL Metadata Manager tools. If GBase-style system
catalog tables are being used at the EDA/SQL Server, and the object is
a table and not a remote procedure, the GBase-style system catalog
tables also must be repopulated, with the egwdba utility, after the EDA
system catalog tables have been updated with EDASAF or the EDA/SQL
Metadata Manager.


-29064	Unknown EDA datatype received.

The output EDA data type that the Gateway received is an unknown EDA
type. The Gateway might receive an unknown data type if it is connected
to an EDA/SQL Server at a release level that the Gateway does is not
support. If the Gateway does support this release level, this message
indicates an internal error either for the EDA products that are being
used or for the Gateway.


-29065	Input host variables not allowed in EXECUTE PROCEDURE.

You used a parameter marker for at least one of the input parameter
values in the dynamic EXECUTE PROCEDURE statement that is being
prepared. Parameter markers are not supported for input parameters in
EXECUTE PROCEDURE statements that the Gateway processes. Rewrite your
application to avoid the use of input host variables as input
parameters to the EXECUTE PROCEDURE statement.


-29066	Password required in .netrc entry for 'userid'.

The .netrc file contains an entry that maps from the current user ID
(userid) to a new user ID that will be sent to the remote server or
data source. In this case, the new user ID is different from the
current user ID, but no password is specified to be sent with the new
user ID to the remote server or data source. This error occurs because
the Gateway has not authenticated the new user ID, and the remote
server or data source cannot authenticate the new user ID without a
password. Sending the new user ID without a password implies to the
remote server or data source that the Gateway has authenticated the new
user ID (which the Gateway has not done).


-29067	Could not access EDALINK.CFG file (reason).

The EDALINK.CFG file could not be accessed for the reason that is
stated. When reason is of the form name: number, number indicates the
operating-system error while accessing a file or directory with the
specified name. Usually, the failure occurs because the EDALINK.CFG
file is not in the Gateway $GBASEDBTDIR/etc directory. The EDALINK.CFG
file is an EDA/Link configuration file that is required to connect to
an EDA/SQL Server. Consult your EDA/Link documentation to
determine the contents of the file.


-29068	A field value received from the EDA Server could not be decoded.

In the row that is being fetched, a field value could not be decoded
and converted into an GBase data value. Usually this situation
occurs because the EDA/SQL Server could not convert the field value
from its actual value in the underlying data source to its specified
Master File Description (MFD) usage format. For example, if the usage
format in the table MFD is I2 (integer value with a maximum field
length of 2 characters), and the value of the field is 300, then the
EDA/SQL Server cannot fit 300 into the specified 2-character field
length.

In this case, the Gateway issues the error because the EDA/SQL Server
has sent a sentinel value in place of the real field value. Check that
the usage format field-length specifications in the MFD are long enough
to hold the actual field values that your data contains. If this action
does not solve the problem, contact GBase Technical Support for
assistance in tracing the data that is received from the EDA/SQL
Server.


-29070	Package isolation level does not match for alias_rdbname,
isolation_level

The application-to-package mapping entry for the given alias_rdbname and 
isolation_level points to a package whose isolation level is different than 
isolation_level.

Make sure that the application-to-package entry is valid and that
isolation_level matches the isolation level in the gwbind file for the
mapped package.


-29071	Gateway cannot find package information for package
RDBName.CollectionID.PackageID

Gateway package information for the specified package 
RDBName.CollectionID.PackageID is not found. Perhaps the specified package
has not been bound, or the package mapped in the application-to-package 
mapping is incorrect.

Contact the database administrator (DBA). The DBA can use the gwdba utility
to bind the specified package or to ensure that the package to which the 
application-to-package mapping entry points is valid.


-29080	Target DBMS Error (message_token).

The target DBMS (Database Management System) to which the Gateway is
connected has reported the error that is contained in message_token.
Refer to the documentation for the target DBMS to correct the problem.

The format for message_token is as follows:

[DBMS_Error_Code Sqlstate DBMS_Product_id] DBMS_Error_Message

DBMS_Error_Code     is the error code of the target DBMS.

Sqlstate            is the SQLSTATE that is associated with the error. For a
                    list of SQLSTATE codes, see your ODBC documentation.

DBMS_Error_Code     is the error code of the target DBMS.

DBMS_Product_id     is the product ID of the target DBMS.

DBMS_Error_Message  is the error message that the target DBMS generates.
                    This message is truncated if the entire sqlerrm text is
                    longer than 71 bytes.

DBMS_Product_id in message_token has the following format:

Product_Name:Product_Version

Product_Name     is up to the first five characters of the name of the
                 target DBMS product as reported by the ODBC Driver for the
                 product (specifically, the SQL_DBMS_NAME returned by the
                 SQLGetInfo ODBC function).

Product_Version  is the first 10 characters of the version of the target
                 DBMS product as reported by the ODBC Driver for the product
                 (specifically, the SQL_DBMS_VER returned by the ODBC
                 SQLGetInfo function).

Product_Version is a character string of the form nn.nn.nnnn, where
the first two digits are the major version of the target DBMS, the next
two digits are its minor version, and the last four digits are its
release version (for example, 03.01.0000). An Oracle7 DBMS_Product_id
might be Oracl:07.01.0000.

If the connection attempt to the target DBMS was not completely
successful, then DBMS_Product_id will be :00.00.0000.


-29081	ODBC Error (message_token).

An ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) component that the Gateway uses to
access the target DBMS has reported the error that message_token
contained. Refer to your ODBC documentation to correct the problem.

The format for message_token is as follows:

[ODBC_Error_Code Sqlstate Driver_Prod_id] ODBC_Error_Message

ODBC_Error_Code     is the error code of the ODBC component. (It can be 0.)

Sqlstate            is the SQLSTATE that is associated with the error. For a
                    list of SQLSTATE codes, see your ODBC documentation.

Driver_Prod_id      is the product ID of the ODBC driver that is being used.

ODBC_Error_Message  is the error message that the ODBC component provided.
                    This message is truncated if the entire sqlerrm text is
                    longer than 71 bytes.

Driver_Prod_id has the following format:

  Driver_Name:Driver_Version

    Driver_Name     is up to the first 5 characters of the name of the file
                    that contains the ODBC Driver that is being used for the
                    connection (specifically, the SQL_DRIVER_NAME that the
                    SQLGetInfo ODBC function returned). If the connection
                    has not yet been established, Driver_Name is blank.

    Driver_Version  is the first 10 characters of the version of the ODBC
                    Driver (specifically, the SQL_DRIVER_VER that the ODBC
                    SQLGetInfo function returned). The Driver_Version is a
                    character string of the form nn.nn.nnnn, where the first
                    2 digits are the major version of ODBC Driver, the next
                    2 digits are its minor version, and the last 4 digits
                    are its release version (for example, 02.00.0000). An
                    Oracle7 Driver_Prod_id might be libor:01.02.0006.

If the connection attempt to the target DBMS was not completely
successful, then Driver_Prod_id will be:00.00.0000.


-29082	Could not decode field value for field number field-number.

In the row that is being fetched, the field value for the field that is
numbered field-number could not be decoded and converted into an
GBase data value. The field number is the ordinal position of the
field that could not be converted in the select list. This situation
reflects an error in the ODBC Driver for the target DBMS. The field
value that could not be decoded is written to the Gateway log file
along with the Driver Name and Version information.

Contact your ODBC Driver supplier for a solution to the problem.


-29083	Compatible isolation level not supported by the data source.

If you received this error code when you executed a SET ISOLATION TO
statement, the attempt to set the isolation level at the data source to
a level compatible with the level in the statement has failed. The
current isolation level in your application remains in effect.

If you receive this error code when you are executing a distributed SQL
statement, the statement has failed because the data source does not
support an isolation level that is compatible to the current isolation
level of your application. The current isolation level in your
application remains in effect.

A compatible isolation level is equal to or higher than the requested
(or current, if a distributed statement) isolation level. When the
requested (or current) isolation level is supported at the data source,
GBase Enterprise Gateway Manager sets the data-source isolation
level to that level. When the requested or current isolation level is
not supported at the data source, if any higher levels are supported,
GBase Enterprise Gateway Manager sets the data-source isolation
level to the next available higher level.

If a lower isolation level that the data source supports is acceptable
to your application, set the isolation level to that lower level. If
you are accessing GBase Enterprise Gateway Manager in direct access
mode, use the GWDIRECTMIL environment variable to set the isolation
level. If you are accessing GBase Enterprise Gateway Manager in
distributed-access mode, issue the SQL statement SET ISOLATION TO
before you execute the distributed statement that accesses the
Gateway.


-29084	Write access is not permitted to data source.

Your application is connected to a database server that supports
transactions, but the data source that is being accessed in the
statement does not support transactions. In this configuration,
non-SELECT SQL statements (that is, actual or potential write
operations) cannot be issued to the data source.

In this case, the data source does not have the capability to match the
transaction characteristics of the coordinating database server. A
write operation cannot be guaranteed to be atomic on the data source
(for example, a write to a file might start successfully but eventually
fail because of insufficient disk space, leaving the file partially
modified). Also, a write operation cannot be rolled back after it has
been performed on the data source. For these reasons, write operations
are not permitted when the coordinating database server supports
transactions (that is, has a log), and the data source does not support
transactions.

If distributed write access to the data source is required, access the
data source from a non-ANSI database without logging (or that has
logging turned off).


-29085	Cursor hold is not supported by the data source.

The data source does not support cursors that are declared WITH HOLD.
Either the target DBMS does not support cursors that remain open after
a commit operation, or the ODBC Driver does not use cursors with this
property. Cursors that are declared WITH HOLD cannot be used at the
data source.


-29087	Network Protocol Communication error.
GBase-SQLCODE,native-protocol-rc: code

An GBase communications-related SQLCODE value and a hexadecimal
native-network protocol return code are returned as a token in SQLERRM.

GBase-SQLCODE is a platform-independent return code that the GBase
communications adaptation service generates. For a more specific description
of the error, refer to the explanation of this SQLCODE value.

The native-protocol-rc value is a return code generated by the local network
communications service that provides the protocol support on each particular
platform. For an explanation of this return code, refer to the manufacturer's
documentation for the protocol support that provides the underlying
communications service.

Ensure that the native-network communications service is installed correctly
and that the target AS is configured correctly and is currently running.

Example: If the communications protocol is TCP/IP, then the
native-protocol-rc value is the return code that the local TCP/IP
service generates.


-29088	Communication buffer size (size) is not valid.

The send buffer that the GBase connectivity network module allocated is
less than the minimum DRDA-required size, which is 512 bytes, or more than
the maximum size, which is 32,767 bytes.

Check the sqlhosts file on the Gateway computer. If the send buffer size is
configurable through the sqlhosts file, make sure that the send buffer size
is configured to be from 512 bytes to 32,767 bytes, inclusive.

If the network protocol being used is TCP/IP, an additional 6 bytes are
required by the GBase connectivity network module. This means the user
specifiable block size minimum is 518 bytes and maximum is 32,773 bytes.


-29089	RDB password required when client user('<username>') is not
authenticated by Gateway.

This error occurs when the Gateway has not authenticated the client user ID
(gwd is started with the '-b' option) and the application does not specify a
password with the user ID.

Regardless of the security configuration of the remote database server, the
Gateway expects to receive a password along with the user ID for the remote
server when gwd is started with the '-b' option. In this case, the Gateway
delegates user ID authentication to the remote server entirely.

Make sure that the password is supplied to the Gateway.
