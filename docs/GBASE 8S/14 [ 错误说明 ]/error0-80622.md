0	Success.

The operation succeeded. The database server returns this SQLCODE value
to an application when an SQL statement executes successfully.


100	No matching records found.

The database server did not find any more data. This message is an ANSI-
standard SQLCODE value. If you attempted to select or fetch data, you
encountered the end of the data, or no data matched the criteria in the
WHERE clause. Check for an empty table. Use this SQLCODE value to determine
when a statement reaches the end of the data. For more information, see the
discussion of SQLCODE in the GBase ESQL/C Programmer's Manual. The
database server can return this SQLCODE value to a running program.

-25507	You specified an unknown service name or protocol.

Determine which of the following conditions produced this error and take the 
appropriate corrective actions:

The value of the NETTYPE configuration parameter in the ONCONFIG file is not 
the same as the NETTYPE setting in the sqlhosts file. If the NETTYPE values 
are different, correct the incorrect value. If you update the ONCONFIG file, 
you must restart the database server.

The correct service name is not in the /etc/services file. If you are using the TCP/IP protocol, check the /etc/services file. If you are using NFS, use the 
ypmake utility to check the /etc/services file. Sometimes the daemon does not 
recognize service names that are added after a default start-up. Add the 
correct service name if it is not present or restart your computer.

The protocol entry in the ONCONFIG file or sqlhosts file is not supported by 
the operating system on your computer. For information about supported 
protocols, see the connectivity information section in the Administrator's 
Guide or the Client SDK release notes in the GBASEDBTDIR/release directory. 
Correct the protocol entry in the ONCONFIG file or the sqlhosts file. If you 
update the ONCONFIG file, you must restart the database server.

Examine the /etc/services file to verify that the requested service
name exists. Also check that the /etc/services file specifies the
correct protocol and/or port number.


25544	The sqlexecd daemon cannot find a host structure.

Check that you requested a valid database server name. Examine the /etc/hosts
file to verify that you correctly defined the requested database server name,
client address, and host names.


25545	The sqlexecd daemon cannot advertise the specified service name.

You are starting the sqlexecd daemon on a system that is running
portable GBase OnLine for NetWare with IPX/SPX as the network
protocol, but the daemon is unable to advertise the service name for
the database server on the NetWare network. It is possible that
another sqlexecd daemon is already using the same service name, a
recently stopped sqlexecd daemon with the same service name was unable
to de-advertise its service, or the database server is down.

The service name of each database server must be unique across the
entire NetWare network. The default service name is sqlexec. If
another sqlexecd daemon or database server on the network already uses
the name, use a different service name to start the sqlexecd daemon.
You can explicitly specify a service name as a parameter in the
sqlexecd command line.

If you are restarting a recently terminated sqlexecd daemon, the
previous sqlexecd probably has not finished de-advertising or was
unable to de-advertise the service name. When you terminate an sqlexecd
daemon, use the TERM signal (15) only (that is, kill -15 pid or kill
pid). If you do not terminate a service properly, depending on your
database server configuration, it might take about three minutes for a
terminated service to be de-advertised automatically.


29061	EDA warning (EDA_warning).

The SQL statement has executed successfully, but the EDA client or
server issued a warning. The EDA_warning field contains the warning
information.

The format of the EDA_warning field is the same as for the EDA_Error
field that is described for error message -29060.


32700	Cannot find license file.

The program cannot open the license file. It first tries to open the
file that the user specified in LM_LICENSE_FILE. If you have not set
this environment variable, the program tries to open the license file
in the default location $GBASEDBTDIR/etc/ifmxld.dat. If you intend to
use LM_LICENSE_FILE, check that you have set your license-file pathname
correctly in that file.


32701	Invalid license file syntax.

This error occurs if the feature name, daemon name, or server name
exceeds the maximum length allowed, or if the feature line is
incomplete. If you have edited the license file after installation,
check that you did not make a mistake. The maximum length for the
server name is 32 characters. The feature name, daemon name, and
feature lines are generated automatically during installation.


32702	Cannot connect to a license daemon server.

If you edited the license file after installation, check that you did
not make a mistake. This error occurs if the daemon name specified in
the license-file feature line does not match the vendor-daemon name or
if the attempt to connect the vendor daemon on all server nodes was
unsuccessful. Check that the daemons on all license servers are still
running and that the network is working properly.


32703	Licensed number of users already reached. Check the daemon log.

Check the network-licensing activities by using lmstat or by checking
the license-daemon log file to decide whether you need to purchase more
user capacity from GBase.


32704	No such feature exists.

The feature could not be found in the license file. Be sure that the
license file contains the feature line for the product that you are
trying to use and that the product is properly licensed.


32705	No TCP/IP license service exists.

Check the license file in use to ensure that the TCP/IP port number on
the server line or lines is valid. If the TCP/IP port number is not
valid, modify the license file to use a valid one.


32706	No socket connection to license manager server.

This error indicates that an internal error occurred during sending or
receiving of the message. Note all observed behavior and any other
error message. Check with the system administrator to ensure that the
system is functioning properly.


32707	Encryption code in license file is inconsistent.

This error indicates that the code in a license-file line does not
match the other data in the license file. This error usually occurs
when all the software components are not built with the same encryption
code. Check create_license.c, ls_vendor.c, and your application code
carefully to make sure that they have the same vendor code. Do not
modify the encryption code in the license file after it has been
generated during installation.


32708	Invalid host.

This error occurs when the host ID specified in the license file does
not match the node on which the software is running.


32709	Feature has expired.

The present date exceeds the expiration date of the feature in the
license file. Decide if you want to change from an evaluation version
to a regular version of this GBase product and contact GBase for
the procedure that you need.


32710	Invalid date format in license file.

Check that the date field in the license file is in the format
dd-mmm-yyyy where dd is two digits for the day, mmm is three letters
for the month, and yyyy is four digits for the year. The installation
procedure generates these dates. If you did not modify the license file
on those fields, report this problem, along with the output of the
license file, to GBase Technical Support.


32711	Invalid returned data from license daemon server.

Be sure that no other services use the port numbers on the server
lines. Check with your system administrator to ensure that the network
is functioning properly. Check the license-daemon-server log for all
error messages.


32712	No server lines in license file.

No server line exists in the license file. All nonzero license-count
features need at least one server line.


32713	Cannot find SERVER hostname in network database.

Check all relevant system files, such as /etc/hosts, to ensure that the
server host name is known across the network.


32714	Cannot read data from license daemon server.

Be sure that the daemons in all license servers are running. Check the
daemon log for any error message.


32715	Cannot write data to license daemon server.

Check with your system administrator to ensure that the network is
functioning properly. Also check the daemon log for other error
messages.


32716	License daemon server does not support this feature.

The feature has expired or has not yet started, or the version of the
product you are attempting to use is not the licensed version. Check
that the license files in both the license-daemon servers and the
computer that is running this GBase licensed product are set up
properly.


32717	License daemon server busy (no majority).

The license-daemon server is busy establishing a quorum of server nodes
so that licensing can start. Retry this operation later.


32718	License file does not support this version.

Be sure that the version of the product that you are attempting to use
is licensed. Check the license file to ensure that the version of the
desired product on the feature line is the same as or later than the
version that you want to use.


32719	Feature checkin failure detected at license daemon server.

The check-in request did not receive a proper reply from the vendor
daemon. (The license might still be considered in use.) Check the
daemon log output to see if there are any more error messages. If the
error recurs, note all circumstances and contact 
GBase Technical Support.


32720	License daemon server temporarily busy (new server connecting).

The vendor daemon is busy establishing a quorum condition. New requests
from clients are deferred during this period. Retry this operation
later.


32721	License daemon server does not support this version of this feature.

The version that you are attempting to use is more recent than the
version for which you are licensed. Check the feature line in the
license file to ensure that the version of the desired product is the
same as or later than the version that you are trying to use.


32722	Request for more licenses than this feature supports.

A checkout request was made for more licenses than are supported in the
license file. Be sure that you did not make a change to the license
checkout request to check out more licenses than it is capable of
handling. Check out only one license for each request.


32723	Cannot read license file.

Be sure that the license file has the correct read permission.


32724	Bad encryption handshake with daemon.

The client performs an encryption handshake operation with the daemon
before any licensing operations can occur. This handshake operation
failed. Check with the system administrator to ensure that the system
and the network are working properly. If the error recurs, note
all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


32725	Feature database corrupted in daemon.

The runtime-feature data structures of the daemon are corrupt. This
internal daemon error indicates that a serious problem exists. If the
error recurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


32726	Cannot allocate dynamic memory.

The malloc() call failed to return sufficient memory. This error can
occur while the system is reading the features from the license file
(especially if the user has set an extremely long LM_LICENSE_FILE path).
Check with your system administrator to ensure that the system is working
properly.


32727	Feature was never checked out.

This message provides information to the user. It is not an error.


32728	Clock setting check not available in daemon.

This message provides information to the user. It is not an error.


32766	Unknown error message number.

The program that you have started cannot locate the GBasedbt error
message file. The GBASEDBTDIR environment variable is probably not set
properly. GBASEDBTDIR points to the directory that contains the msg
directory where message files are stored.


32788	Dbspaces added to a mirrored Dbslice must be mirrored.

The database administrator attempted to add dbspaces to an existing
mirrored dbslice by using the ALTER DBSLICE ADD DBSPACE command
without the MIRROR clause for each chunk.

Reissue the ALTER DBSLICE ADD DBSPACE command with the MIRROR clause
for each chunk.


32789	Dbspaces added to a non-mirrored Dbslice must not be mirrored.

The database administrator attempted to add dbspaces to an existing
unmirrored dbslice by using the ALTER DBSLICE ADD DBSPACE command
with at least one MIRROR clause for a chunk.

Reissue the ALTER DBSLICE ADD DBSPACE command without the MIRROR clause
for each chunk.


32792	Coservers successfully blocked.
