Your application was unable to start a database server process or was
unable to create a process that was needed for some subordinate
function such as a REPORT TO pipe or a network-access program. This
error probably reflects a limit configured in your operating system.
Look for other operating-system error messages that might give more
information.


-68	Too many users.

involved. Contact your system administrator to inquire about more
liberal quotas.


-70	Stale NFS file handle.

An operating-system error code with the meaning shown was unexpectedly
returned to the database server. An error exists in a file server on a
networked file system. Although GBase database servers do not
support database access to NFS-mounted file systems, this error can
occur when the database server executable files or other files that are
related to the database server are located on an NFS-mounted disk. (In
other words, the GBASEDBTDIR environment variable names an NFS-mounted
disk.) The error is usually transient, reflecting a crash and
subsequent restart of the file server. Remount the file system to your
workstation and rerun your application.

returned to the database server. If the error recurs, note all
circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-78	Deadlock situation detected/avoided.

An operating-system error code with the meaning shown was unexpectedly
returned to the database server. If the error recurs, note all
circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.

Under AIX, this code means connection timed out.


-79	No record locks available.

An operating-system error code with the meaning shown was unexpectedly
returned to the database server. This implementation of the GBase
database server probably uses kernel locking, the use of the
operating-system facilities to lock rows of tables. The capacity of the
operating-system lock table has been exceeded. Contact your system
administrator and inquire about configuring the operating system to
support more locks. Also examine your database application to see if it
can use fewer locks by updating fewer rows in each transaction or by
locking whole tables instead of rows.


-100	ISAM error: duplicate value for a record with unique key.

A row that was to be inserted or updated has a key value that already
exists in its index. For C-ISAM programs, a duplicate value was
presented in the last call to iswrite, isrewrite, isrewcurr, or
isaddindex. Review the program logic and the input data. For SQL
products, a duplicate key value was used in the last INSERT or UPDATE.
