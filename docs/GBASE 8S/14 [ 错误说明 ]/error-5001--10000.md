-5001	CSM: memory allocation error.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, could not acquire memory for processing.

Make sure that the system configuration makes sufficient memory available
for dynamic allocation. If that fails, contact GBase Technical Support
or the CSM vendor and have the following information available: CSS
configuration files and sqlhosts information for both the client and the
database server.


-5002	CSM: memory de-allocation error.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, could not deallocate memory. This error message arises only when
some form of memory corruption has occurred.

Contact GBase Technical Support or the CSM vendor and have the
following information available: CSS configuration files and sqlhosts
information for both the client and the database server.


-5003	CSM: file I/O error.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, could not complete a file read or write operation successfully.
This error can occur only during use of a CSM.

Validate that all files that the CSM requires for operation are available
for read and write access by the user in the client or by user gbasedbt
in the database server. If that fails, contact GBase Technical Support
or the  CSM vendor and have the following information available: CSS
configuration files and sqlhosts information for both the client and the
database server.


-5004	CSM: invalid context.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, detected a context that contains invalid data or that is
inconsistent with the current operation or CSM state. This error normally
occurs during input or output message processing (as opposed to context
establishment).

Contact GBase Technical Support or the CSM vendor and have the
following information available: CSS configuration files and sqlhosts
information for both the client and the database server.


-5005	CSM: unsupported feature.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, found either a global or connection parameter specification that
the current version of the CSM does not support. The CSM could also find
that the peer CSM, through the internal CSM-to-CSM protocol, indicated
the use of an option that this CSM instance does not support.

Remove any option that the CSM does not support or upgrade the CSM to one
that supports the option. Install and activate matching versions of the
CSMs in the client and database server. If the problem recurs, contact 
GBase Technical Support or the CSM vendor and have the following
Information available: CSS configuration files and sqlhosts information
for both the client and the database server.


-5006	CSM: invalid global options.

A CSM (Communications Support Module) found a global option that the
current version of the CSM does not support. The global option string is
specified in the CSS configuration file. 

Remove any options that the CSM does not support from the global option
specification or upgrade the CSM to one that supports the options. If the problem recurs,
contact GBase Technical Support or the CSM vendor and have
the following information available: CSS configuration files and sqlhosts
information for both the client and the database server.


-5007	CSM: invalid context options: <text>

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, found a CSM connection option specification that the current
version of the CSM does not support. The connection options string is
specified in the CSS configuration file, and the csm option field in the
sqlhosts file. The text in the error message shows any options that the
CSM does not support.

Remove any options that the CSM does not support from the CSM connection
option specification or upgrade the CSM to one that supports the options.
If the problem recurs, contact GBase Technical Support or the CSM vendor and
have the following information available: CSS configuration files and
sqlhosts information for both the client and the database server.




-5008	CSM: peer disconnected.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the


client, received a message from the peer CSM (using their private 
CSM-to-CSM protocol) to initiate an orderly tear-down of their respective
CSM contexts. This CSM responded by returning to the caller (CSS and its
caller) with this message. This message might not be an error, but might
actually be part of the protocol. A typical event that might trigger this
disconnection is the expiration of a credential (such as an old Kerberos
ticket, an association that is too long if the CSM functionality includes
placing limits on the duration of SQL sessions, or an expired X.509 
certificate). This error can occur only during use of a CSM.

If the disconnection seems unexpected and the problem persists, contact
GBase Technical Support or the CSM vendor and have the following
information available: CSS configuration files and sqlhosts information
for both the client and the database server.


-5009	CSM: authentication error.

A CSM (Communications Support Module) that performs principal 
authentication either in the database server or in the client failed to
authenticate the principal. 

If this error occurs during session establishment, the connection
establishment fails. Otherwise, the connection is dropped.

A common cause for this error is that an invalid password is given or the
desired database server does not consider the client computer or your
user ID trusted.

Provide a correct password as required by the authentication. Or ask the
system administrator to include the client computer as a trusted host
and/or your user ID as a trusted user in the /etc/hosts.equiv file on the
database server computer or in the .rhosts file in your home directory on
the database server computer. For more information, see the UNIX manual
pages on HOSTS.EQUIV(5).

If the problem recurs, contact GBase Technical Support and have the following
information available: CSS configuration files and sqlhosts information
for both the client and the database server.


-5010	CSM: internal processing error.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, detected an internal processing error and is incapable of
self-diagnosing it to provide additional information. This error can
occur only during use of a CSM and normally represents an internal
processing error, but could be caused by an undetected protocol error.

If this error occurs during context setup (that is, at connection time),
the connection establishment fails. If this error occurs after
establishment of the connection, the connection is dropped.

Contact GBase Technical Support or the CSM vendor and have the
following information available: CSS configuration files and sqlhosts
information for both the client and the database server.


-5011	CSM: protocol error.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, received a message that is not consistent with the CSM's protocol
formats, with its internal state, or with both. The usual cause of this
error is an internal message inconsistency, which indicates the receipt
of a protocol data unit with an unknown format. This error can occur only
during use of a CSM, and the cause can be a communications error, the use
of incompatible versions of the CSM in the client and the database
server, or inconsistent configurations of the client and database server
CSMs.

If this error occurs during context setup (that is, at connection time),
the connection establishment fails. If this error occurs after
establishment of the connection, the connection is dropped.

Make sure that the release levels of the CSMs types match, and the
configurations of client and database server CSMs match. If the problem recurs,
contact GBase Technical Support or the CSM vendor and have the
following information available: CSS configuration files and sqlhosts
information for both the client and the database server.


-5012	CSM: received message of unexpected type.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, received a message with a type that is inconsistent with the
protocol formats and/or internal state. This message is more specific
than message -5011 because in this case the protocol data unit that is
internally consistent might be carrying a message type that the receiver
cannot handle. This error can occur only if a CSM is used. It can be
caused by a communications error, by the use of incompatible versions of
the CSM in the client and the database server, or by inconsistent
configurations of the client and database server CSMs.

If this error occurs during context setup (that is, at connection time),
The connection establishment fails. If this error occurs after
Establishment of the connection, the connection is dropped.

Make sure that the release versions of the CSMs types match, and the
configurations of client and database server CSMs match. If the problem recurs,
contact GBase Technical Support or the CSM vendor and have the
following information available: CSS configuration files and sqlhosts
information for both the client and the database server.


-5013	CSM: cannot obtain credential: authentication error.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, cannot obtain a credential to proceed in an authentication
exchange. For example, a user did not provide a password, or a credential
request to an external authentication service returned an error. This
error can only occur during context setup (that is, at connection time).

The connection establishment fails.

When a CSM is configured to require a password for authentication, a
valid password must be provided. Do not configure the database server to
use CSM in such a way that password input is required when you first
bring up the database server. Bring the database server up and let it
build system tables. Bring the database server down, and reconfigure it
to use the CSM as you desire.

Provide the password credential, or perform the operations that the
external authentication service provider requires in advance (for
example, Kerberos klogin).


-5030	CSM: crypto library error: <text>.

A CSM (Communications Support Module), in the database server or in the
client, received an error indication from its cryptographic service
provider (or crypto library). This error can occur only during use of a
CSM and normally represents an internal processing error, but an
undetected protocol error could cause this error as well. Additional
text, crypto-library return codes, or both might follow the error
message.

If this error occurs during context setup (that is, at connection time),
the connection establishment fails. If this error occurs after
establishment of the connection, the connection is dropped.

Contact GBase Technical Support or the CSM vendor and have the
following information available: CSS configuration files and sqlhosts
information for both the client and the database server.

server. This database server does not support NLS. Contact GBase
for a version that does support NLS.


-7211	Cannot reference an external NLS database.

If your current database is not an NLS database, you cannot access an
NLS database on another database server or on the same database
server. However, if the NLS environment variables are set correctly,
you can drop an external NLS database even if your current database is
not an NLS database.

-7350	Attempt to update a stale version of a row

An attempt was made to update a stale copy of a row.  This caused an
optimistic concurrancy failure.

This error can occur when using updatable secondary and the current
version of the row has not yet been replicated to the secondary on which
the client application is connected.

This error code is also returned when table schema at secondary server
doesn't match with the table schema at primary server.

-7351	Connection between secondary and primary has been lost

The connection between the secondary and the primary has been lost.  This
will prevent the updates on secondary until connectivity has been
reestablished.


-7352	Operation can not be run on secondary node

There was an attempt to run an operation on a secondary node which can
only be successfully run on the primary.  You will need to perform
the operation on the current primary node


-7353	The transaction cannot continue on the new primary server.

The transaction was started at a secondary server.  While processing the
transaction, the original primary server to which the secondary server was
connected went off-line and another server became the new primary server.
There was an error recreating the transaction state at the new primary
server.


-7400	Invalid API argument <argument-name>.

Verify the arguments to the DataBlade API calls.


-7401	Invalid API usage <API-call>.

A DataBlade API call used an invalid argument or was made in an incorrect
context. The value of one or more arguments might be invalid, the sequence
of DataBlade API calls might be incorrect, or the call might have been made
from within a callback function where the call is invalid.

Check that the values of individual arguments are valid in the API call and
that the combination of all argument values is correct. Also check the
sequence of your DataBlade API calls. If the API call named in the
error message is made from within a callback function, move the call or
remove it.


-7402	Internal error.

If this error occurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical
Support.


-7403	File protocol error. Expected message_packet_name.

compatible with the locale that was specified when the database was
created.


-7420	Argument argument_name is invalid.

Verify the arguments to the DataBlade API calls.


-7421	The specified column position is invalid.

Check the arguments to the DataBlade API calls that require column
numbers. DataBlade API calls use column numbers 0 to number of columns
minus one.


-7422	Cannot issue SAPI function <function-name> in a secondary PDQ
thread. You need to define the user-defined routine as non-parallelizable.

A user-defined routine that was defined as parallelizable has issued a SAPI
function that is not PDQ thread-safe. Only nonparallelizable user-defined
routines can call such a SAPI function.

Drop the routine and redefine it as nonparallelizable. To define a routine
as nonparallelizable, reissue the CREATE FUNCTION, CREATE PROCEDURE, or
CREATE ROUTINE statement without the WITH (PARALLELIZABLE) class. Or you can
use the following statement to make a routine nonparallelizable:

    ALTER ROUTINE routine-name WITH (DROP PARALLELIZABLE)


-7423	An invalid argument is specified. Either the return type buffer is
empty or the length of the buffer is not valid.

Verify arguments to DataBlade API calls.


-7424	A Cursor can only be defined for a prepared SELECT statement.

Prepare your SELECT statement before you define the cursor.


-7425	Invalid statement handle.

Verify arguments to DataBlade API calls. The statement handle used was
invalid or improperly modified.


-7426	There is no active query on this connection.

Verify the logic in the user-defined routine. You cannot retrieve or
query results without an active query.

-7500	Invalid multibyte character in syserrors catalog table for sqlstate
SQLSTATE_value.

An invalid multibyte character has entered the syserrors catalog
table. Possibly, the syserrors.locale is not the actual locale used
for syserrors.message. This table is normally populated with DataBlade
messages or possibly messages from user-defined routines.


-7503	The BLOB or CLOB data size provided differs from the client file size.

The size of the BLOB or CLOB data that was provided in a load command is not 
the same as the actual size of the smart large object client file. 
Verify that the data size provided in the load command is correct or check if 
the smart large object client file is incomplete or corrupted.


-7510	API use not valid in callback (<routine>).

You cannot call this routine in the callback.

GBase Technical Support.


-7540	Routine's return value ID is out of range.

If this error recurs, note all circumstances and contact
GBase Technical Support.


-7542	Cast user-defined-routine lookup failed.

Verify spelling and definition of types used in the routine signature.
If this error recurs, note all circumstances and contact
GBase Technical Support.

-7546	Unknown routine type <text>, routine type must be one of 'f'
or 'p'.

You used an invalid routine type when using mi_create_signature() to 
create a function or procedure.

Specify either 'f' or 'p' as the routine type.


-7547	Routine name is missing in call to mi_create_signature.

Verify that you included all required parameters in your call to the
mi_create_signature() function. For the complete syntax of
mi_create_signature(), refer to the DataBlade API Function Reference.


-7549	Cannot use mi_funcmap_get on remote routines.

This routine must be used with functions that are in the local database.

Remove references to routines on remote databases from mi_funcmap_get().


-7580	Invalid attempt to call routine: this routine may only be called
from an am_check routine.
 
You tried to call the specified routine from a UDR other than 
a VTI/VII am_check routine. Outside of am_check routines, use 
mi_db_error_raise to report messages and errors. 


-7590	Cannot read past the end of stream marker.

After a call to mi_stream_eof() would have returned MI_TRUE, indicating
the end of the file or stream, another read operation was attempted. You
cannot read past the end-of-stream marker.

Once the mi_stream_eof() function returns MI_TRUE, terminate read
operations to avoid this error.


-7591	This is a generic mi_stream failure.

An unspecified mi_stream error occurred. The cause is not clearly
known.

Check the stream-type documentation for any details.


-7592	The mi_stream function being called is not implemented.

An attempt was made to execute an unimplemented mi_stream
operation, such as mi_stream_read(), mi_stream_write(), or
mi_stream_seek(). Not all mi_stream types support all mi_stream
functions.

Check the functional definition for the stream being used to ensure
that the function that returns this status has been implemented.


-7593	During an mi_stream operation a Send side failure has occurred.

During an mi_stream operation, the send side of a data transfer
encountered problems, and the data transfer failed. This status is
usually associated with Enterprise Replication (ER) operations.

Check the log files for any additional information.


-7594	During an mi_stream operation a Receive side failure has occurred.

During an mi_stream operation, the receive side of a data transfer
encountered problems, and the data transfer failed. This status is
usually associated with Enterprise Replication (ER) operations.


-7595	An error has occurred during the conversion or manipulation of
the ifx_int8 involved with an mi_stream operation.

A conversion operation for ifx_int8 values failed.

Check the values being used to verify that they match the types required
and are set with valid data.


-7596	An mi_stream seek has occurred using a bad whence value.

A call to mi_stream_seek() received a seek parameter that is in
error.

Use one of the following values:

   MI_LO_SEEK_SET or SEEK_SET
   MI_LO_SEEK_CUR or SEEK_CUR
   MI_LO_SEEK_END or SEEK_END


-7597	An attempt to determine the shared library module ID for an
mi_stream operation has failed.

An mi_stream function address lookup failed. The shared-library
module handle is set to NULL to indicate that no shared library is
currently loaded.

Check the log files for any errors that might have occurred when
an attempt was made to load the library. Common load problems
include an incorrect library path and a library that does not
exist at the designated location.


-7598	The mi_stream function symbol lookup in a shared library failed.

An mi_stream function symbol name was not found in the given
shared-library module.

Check that the spelling of the function symbol name is correct.


-7599	The mi_stream function address lookup in a shared library failed.

An mi_stream function address could not be resolved using the function
name provided. The function handle could not be mapped to a real
executable address.

Check the log files for any errors that might have occurred when
an attempt was made to load the library. Check the spelling of
the function name.


-7601	Bad cursor action: Subquery collections only support cursor
action MI_CURSOR_NEXT.

A cursor action other than MI_CURSOR_NEXT was used on a subquery collection.

Remove any invalid cursor actions. For subquery collections, use only the
MI_CURSOR_NEXT cursor action or open the subquery collection without the
flags MI_COLL_NOSCROLL and MI_COLL_READONLY.


-7602	Internal error: Invalid field count for a row.

This is an internal error.

If it recurs, note all circumstances and contact
GBase Technical Support.


-7607	Invalid row literal value.

A row literal should be well-formed with respect to its syntax and the type
of objects contained in the literal. For a description of the syntax and
semantics of Literal Row, refer to the GBase Guide to SQL: Syntax.


-7610	Invalid collection literal value.

Your collection value is not well-formed.

See the documentation for a description of the construction of collection
literal values.


-8001	The number of newlines specified for TOP MARGIN, FIRST PAGE HEADER
(PAGE HEADER), PAGE TRAILER, and BOTTOM MARGIN must leave enough room on the
page for the printing of the ON EVERY RECORD clause.

The total number of lines that are defined for all the above statements
exceeds the page length. Check that you entered the desired number of
lines in each statement in the OUTPUT section and in the header and
trailer specifications of the FORMAT section.


-8002	The ACE report specification is too complex or large to be properly
compiled. The number of instructions needed to implement this specification is
greater than the space that is allocated in the instruction tables for the
compiler.

Reduce the size of the report. Because you cannot divide a report into
parts to compile separately, you must find a way to simplify the
report.


-8003	A SMALLINTEGER constant may not be larger than 32767.

The allowable range of values for a SMALLINT constant is -32,767
through 32,767. Only whole numbers are allowed, with only digit
characters.


-8004	Illegal FLOAT constant.

The FLOAT constant is not written correctly. The exponent might be too
small or too large (the allowable range of exponents depends on your
computer and operating system but is the same as your C compiler allows
for the DOUBLE data type), or incorrect punctuation or a nondigit
character other than e might be present.


-8005	Too many user variables, parameters, or functions have been defined.
You cannot define any more than number in an ACE specification.

The total number of identifiers that are defined for ASCII fields,
parameters, and variables cannot exceed the number that is shown. You
must simplify the report.


-8006	A quoted string may not exceed 80 characters in length.

You must reduce the quoted string to a maximum of 80 characters. In a
PRINT statement, simply divide the string into shorter parts, and
separate the parts with commas.


-8007	There is an unmatched quote in a quoted string.

This line of the report specification contains an odd number of quote
(") symbols. A quoted string cannot include a new-line character; all
quoted strings must be complete in one line. In order to print a longer
string, store its parts in variables and list them all in a PRINT
statement.


-8008	The file filename could not be opened. The operating system was asked
to open it for reading.

Check the spelling of the filename. Make sure that the file exists and
that your account name has read access to it. If the file is in a
directory other than the current directory, you might have to enter a
complete pathname.


-8009	A memory allocation error has occurred. The ACE report specification
is probably too large.

The ACE compiler could not allocate memory that it needed. Try reducing
the size of the report specification.


-8010	The file filename could not be opened. The operating system was asked
to open it for writing. It is possible that a file by the same name already
exists, but the user has no permission to write over it, or, if -o is used,
the  destination directory does not exist.

Ensure that filename is spelled correctly and that your account name
has write access to the directory where it will be stored. (That
directory might be the one that the environment variable DBTEMP names.)
If a file of that name already exists, either erase it or make sure
that your account has write access to it.


-8011	The user function called name has not yet been defined by the user.

A call was made to a function with the name shown. ACE assumes that it
is an external C function. However, external functions must be defined
in the DEFINE section of the report using FUNCTION funcname statements,
and this name is not defined. If name was intended as the name of an
external function, insert a FUNCTION statement for it.


-8013	An error occurred when an attempt was made to open the listing file
filename.  Be certain that the user has write permissions in the current
directory.

Ensure that your account has write access to the current directory. If
a file filename already exists, check that your account has write
access to it.


-8014	Usage: SACEPREP [-q][-o output_directory] input_filename (etc.)

Something in the command line that you entered was not acceptable to
saceprep. Read the message to remind yourself of the syntax of the
various options and then retype the command line.


-8015	An open comment symbol, {, was found inside an already open comment
on line line-number, character char-number. This could be due to a failure
to closethe previously opened comment, which was begun on line lnum,
character cnum.

You cannot nest comments. Insert a close-comment symbol where
appropriate in the report specification.


-8016	A comment has been opened but not closed. The last comment begun was
opened on line line-number, character char-number.

Insert a close-comment symbol where appropriate in the report
specification.


-8017	An illegal (invisible, control) character has been found on line
line-number, character char-number. It has been replaced by a blank in the
listing, but it is still in the source (input) file, and should be removed
before attempting to compile again.

Using a word-processing editor in document mode instead of text mode,
striking nonprinting keys while you are editing the file, or data
corruption can introduce illegal characters into files.


-8018	A grammatical error has been found on line line-number, character
char-number. The construct is not understandable in its context.

A syntax error exists in the source file. A keyword might be misspelled
or misplaced in the file. Check the spelling of the keyword or the
sequence of control blocks within the report-specification file.


-8019	Cannot open temporary file filename for reading of a TEXT column.

For each TEXT column that is selected for the report, ACEGO prepares a
temporary file in the directory that the DBTEMP environment variable
names. This message indicates that the file was created and loaded
with a copy of a TEXT value, but now it cannot be read. Look for
operating-system error messages that might give more details. If the
error recurs, note all circumstances and contact
GBase Technical Support.


-8021	The source file filename cannot be opened. This is probably because
the file does not exist.

Check the spelling of filename. Check that the report-specification
file exists in your current directory, or if it is in another
directory, check that you provided the correct pathname. If this 
information is correct, verify that your account has read permission on the
file.


-8022	This identifier exceeds the maximum length for identifiers, which is 50.

You must devise a shorter identifier.


-8025	The comment close symbol, }, has been found on line line-number,
character char-number, even though no comment has been opened.

Unless comment symbols are enclosed in quotes, they must be balanced.
Probably the open-comment symbol was accidentally deleted during
editing. Change the file so that comments are properly delimited.


-8030	A typographical error has been found on line line-number, character
char-number.

The single character at the location that is shown is not syntactically
correct; it cannot be interpreted as part of a report specification.


-8033	The source file name filename exceeds the maximum length of 10.

The form compiler imposes a limit on the length of source-file
identifiers. You must rename the file before you use it. In DOS
systems, filenames can be a maximum of 8 characters plus a 3-character
extension.


-8034	An unknown option option was found on the command line.

ACEPREP supports the following command-line options:

    *   -s to suppress messages

    *   -o to name an output destination

    *   -ansi to test for ANSI compliance

ACEGO supports the following command-line options:

    *   -s to suppress messages

    *   -d to name a database


-8051	The LEFT MARGIN must be no less than zero and no greater than the RIGHT
MARGIN.

Revise the left and right MARGIN statements in the OUTPUT section to
reasonable margin values.


-8052	There is insufficient space in the compiler string table for the
storage of CHAR variables.

Reduce the length or number of character variables in the report
specification.


-8053	Neither the PAGE LENGTH, TOP MARGIN, nor BOTTOM MARGIN is allowed
to be less than zero.

Revise the statements in the OUTPUT section to have reasonable values.


-8054	The string string does not fit into remaining space in the compiler's
string table.

Reduce the length or number of strings in the report specification.
Identical strings are stored only once.


-8055	This constant causes the constant table in ACEPREP to overflow.

Reduce the number of numeric constants that the report-specification
file uses.


-8056	Skipping lines inside of WHILE or FOR loops is not allowed within PAGE
HEADER or TRAILER.

ACEPREP needs to determine how many lines of space to devote to the
page header and trailer (otherwise, it does not know how many detail
rows to allow on the page). It cannot predict how many times a loop
will be executed, so it has to forbid the use of SKIP statements in
loops in these sections.


-8057	Only user variables of type CHARACTER may be subscripted or have lists
in the LET statement.

You can use a subscript (two numbers in square brackets, used to
extract a substring of characters) with names of character variables
only. In a LET statement, you can assign multiple strings, separated by
commas, to a character variable only. Variables of other types can
receive only single values.


-8058	The ASCII field field-name has already been defined.

A field name can be defined only once. Field names must be unique in
the DEFINE section, that is, a name cannot be used for both a PARAM and
a field.


-8059	The limit for IF statement nesting has been exceeded. There are too
many IF statements within IF statements for ACE to properly compile this
specification.

You have exceeded the maximum levels of nested IF statements. You must
simplify the logic of the report.


-8060	An end-of-file has been prematurely found in the report specification.

ACEPREP encountered the end of the report-specification file while it
still expected input. Possibly you omitted an END statement. A minimal
FORMAT section that contains at least an EVERY ROW statement is
required, and any control block must contain at least one statement.


-8061	This report contains a READ statement but no ASCII record definition
has been specified.

In order to use the READ statement, you must use the ASCII statement in
the DEFINE section to define the expected fields of the ASCII file.


-8062	This report contains a SELECT statement, but a READ statement should
be used instead because an ASCII record definition has be specified.

You can base a report on an ASCII file or on database rows, but not on
both. The ASCII statement in the DEFINE section means that file input
will be used, and a READ statement is used to read the file. If you
want to base the report on database rows, retain the SELECT statement
and delete the ASCII statement.


-8102	There may be only one AFTER or BEFORE GROUP OF clause for any single
column specified in the ORDER BY command.

The report contains more than one AFTER GROUP OF clause for a certain
column or more than one BEFORE GROUP OF clause. Only one of each can
name a given column. However, you can combine the statements from the
multiple clauses into a single clause.


-8103	In order for the BEFORE or AFTER GROUP OF clause to function properly,
the column specified in the clause must also have been specified as a sort
column in the ORDER BY command. If the sort column is subscripted, the column
in the BEFORE or AFTER GROUP OF clause must be also.

Make sure that the control columns are specified identically in both
the ORDER BY statement and the GROUP OF clauses.


-8104	Group aggregates can only be used in an AFTER GROUP OF clause.

Aggregate values over a group are accumulated while the rows of the
group are being processed, so they are not available until the end of
the group is seen. Therefore, the report cannot refer to them except in
an AFTER GROUP OF clause.


-8105	Aggregates may not be used within another aggregate.  Nor may
aggregates be used within the WHERE clause of another aggregate.

Aggregate functions cannot be nested, primarily because the value of
the inner aggregate is not known while the outer aggregate is being
accumulated. Rewrite aggregate expressions to refer only to columns and
simple expressions on columns. In an AFTER GROUP OF clause, you can
save the aggregate value from one group of rows in a variable in order
to use it to compute an aggregate over a subsequent group.


-8107	A user variable or parameter has been defined by the user more than
once.

You can define a name only once in a DEFINE section. You used a name
more than once in the ASCII, PARAM, or VARIABLE statements.


-8108	A user variable or parameter must have a length which is greater than
zero.

Make sure that every CHAR and VARCHAR field in the DEFINE section has a
nonzero length specification.


-8109	Wordwrap may not be used within PAGE HEADERS or TRAILERS.

ACEPREP needs to know how many lines will be filled in header and
trailer sections (otherwise, it does not know how many detail rows to
put on the page). However, printing with the WORDWRAP function can fill
a variable number of lines, depending on the words. Therefore, it is
not allowed in page header or trailer sections.


-8110	The user variable called name has not yet been defined.

The variable, parameter, or field name was not defined in the DEFINE
section. If name is spelled correctly, it must be defined.


-8111	User variables and run-time parameters may not be used in an ORDER BY
statement.

Only names of columns can be used in an ORDER BY clause. Check the
spelling of the column names or display labels in the clause. You
cannot request ordering by the contents of defined variables,
parameters, or ASCII fields.


-8112	Within an IF-THEN-ELSE statement of a header or trailer clause, the
number of lines printed in the IF part must equal the number of lines printed
in the ELSE part.

ACEPREP needs to know how many lines will be filled in header and
trailer sections (otherwise, it does not know how many detail rows to
put on the page). Because it cannot tell which part of an IF statement
will be executed, it requires that both produce the same number of
lines of output.


-8113	SKIP TO TOP OF PAGE is not allowed in any header or trailer clause.

When SKIP TO TOP OF PAGE is executed, the page-trailer clause must be
executed (to display fixed page-end material), followed by the
page-header clause. If the statement was allowed in a header or trailer
clause, an infinite loop could ensue.


-8114	The number of lines to be printed in the top and bottom margins plus
the lines to be printed in the page header and trailer clauses exceeds or
equals the page length.

Examine the statements in the OUTPUT section and in any HEADER and
TRAILER clauses. The total of lines that these statements use must be
sufficiently less than the specified page length that some detail rows
can be printed.


-8115	There may be no more than 8 sort columns specified in the ORDER BY
command.

ACEGO limits the number of columns that can be ordered. You must reduce
the number of columns that are listed following ORDER BY.


-8116	Illegal subscripting in ORDER BY command.

You can only subscript a character field. Check the subscripts. No
negative numbers are allowed; the numbers must fall within the length
of the character column; and the first number must be less than or
equal to the second number.


-8121	The specified WORDWRAP RIGHT MARGIN value is out of range. It must be
greater than or equal to the current column and less than or equal to the
report's right.

The right margin of a WORDWRAP clause is used to set a narrower right
margin than the one that applies to the report as a whole. The
effective left margin of a WORDWRAP display is the current column when
WORDWRAP is processed. The right margin must fall between the current
column and the report margin.


-8122	NEED n LINES may not be used in PAGE HEADER or PAGE TRAILER clauses.

The PRINT statements in a page header or trailer establishes its size.
To set a larger size, use PRINT statements with no parameters.


-8123	The PRINT FILE command is not allowed within the FIRST PAGE HEADER,
PAGE HEADER, or PAGE TRAILER clauses.

ACEPREP needs to know how many lines will be filled in header and
trailer sections (otherwise, it does not know how many detail rows to
put on the page). Because the size of a file cannot be predicted when
the report is compiled, the PRINT FILE command is not allowed. You must
use PRINT statements to produce the data.


-8124	A user variable used in the above query has not been defined in the
DEFINE section.

A variable that is named in the SELECT statement is not defined in the
DEFINE section of the report. Check that all names in the SELECT
statement are the ones that you intended and that you have not
misspelled any column or variable names.


-8125	The keyword END was found more than once inside the SELECT section.
Within the SELECT section, use semicolons to separate SQL statements. Use the
keyword END only after the final SELECT.

Review the contents of the SELECT section to make sure that each SELECT
statement except the last one ends in a semicolon and that the last one
is followed by an END statement. Perhaps you omitted the FORMAT
statement at the beginning of that section.


-8126	PARAM[0] may not be defined.

The first parameter that you can define in the PARAMETER statement is
number 1. In some host-operating systems, the zeroth parameter is
preset to the program name, but this value is not available within a
report.


-8127	You cannot use more than one REPORT TO statement in a report
specification.

The entire report is directed to one destination, which is chosen with
the REPORT TO statement in the OUTPUT section. The report cannot be
divided between multiple destinations, so remove all REPORT TO
statements after the first. If you want to produce separate report
files for different sets of data, perform one of the following steps:

    *   Write a separate report for each set of data (the
	specifications should differ only in their SELECT statements).

    *   Produce a full report, but with sets of data on separate pages,
	and use operating-system utilities and tools to separate the
	files afterward.

    *   Use parameter variables in the SELECT statements so that you
	can choose a subset of data dynamically, when you run the
	report, and use REPORT TO PRINT so that you can set the DBPRINT
	variable to control the output destination before you start the
	report.


-8128	Minimum length of a VARCHAR variable must be smaller than the maximum
size.

A VARCHAR variable is defined with the two numbers name(n,r), where n
is the maximum length of the variable and r is the reserved length. The
reserved length is meaningful only in the context of a database table
definition, although it is allowed when you define a report variable.
If you specify it, you must write a number for r that is less than or
equal to the size, n.


-8129	Specified page length length is too short for default report.

A report page cannot fit in the number of lines that are specified.
Allow more lines per page or revise the report specification to use
fewer lines (for instance, by changing the top or bottom margins).


-8130	An INTEGER constant may not be larger than 2147483647.

This statement specifies a value that cannot be contained in an
integer. Either use a smaller value or a different data type (for
example, DECIMAL).


-8200	User <user-name> does not have DBSECADM authority.

User does not have the necessary permission to perform the operation;
only DBSECADM has the authority to perform this operation. Contact the
DBSECADM to perform this operation.


-8201	The security label component <component-name> already exists.

The security label component to be created is already defined in the
database. For RENAME SECURITY LABEL COMPONENT, a security label
component with the specified new name already exists. Verify that you
have specified the correct component name and that you are in the
correct database.


-8202	The security label component element <element-name> is
already defined.

The security label component element was specified more than once
in the list of security label component elements. For TREE security
label component, the security label component element is already
defined as ROOT or UNDER some other element. Specifying the
element more than once on the left side of UNDER clause is not
allowed. Verify that you have specified the correct component
element name.


-8203	The security label component element <element-name> exceeds 32 bytes.

The security label component element specified exceeds its limit
length of 32 bytes. Specify a shorter name.


-8204	The security label component <component-name> has too many elements.

A security label component can have no more than 64 elements.
Your statement exceeded this limit. Specify a smaller number of
elements within the limit.


-8205	The security label component element <element-name> is not
yet defined.

This error can have any of the following causes:

    *  The element <element-name> is used on the right side of the
       UNDER clause in CREATE or ALTER SECURITY LABEL COMPONENT
       statement but has not yet been defined as being ROOT or
       being UNDER some other element. Define the object as ROOT
       or as being UNDER some defined element.

    *  The element <element-name> is used on the right side of
       BEFORE or AFTER clause of ALTER SECURITY LABEL COMPONENT
       has not yet been defined. Specify a defined or existing
       element name.


-8206	The security policy <policy-name> already exists.

The security policy to be created is already defined in the database.
For RENAME SECURITY POLICY, a security policy with the specified new
name already exists. Verify that you have specified the correct policy
name and that you are in the correct database.


-8207	The security label component <component-name> was specified
more than once.

The security label component was duplicated in the list of components
of a security policy or a security label. Verify that you have specified
the security label component name correctly. Remove any duplicates
from the list of security label components.


-8208	The security label component <component-name> does not exist.

The specified security label component does not exist in the database.
Verify that you have specified the correct security label component
name, and that you are in the correct database.


-8209	The maximum number of components in security policy <policy-name>
has been exceeded.

A security policy can have a maximum of 16 components. You have exceeded
the number of component allowed to make up a security policy.


-8210	The security policy <policy-name> does not exist.

The specified security policy does not exist in the database. Verify
that you have specified the correct security policy name, and that
you are in the correct database.


-8211	The security label <label-name> already exists.

The security label to be created is already defined in the database.
For RENAME SECURITY LABEL, a security label with the specified new
name already exists. Verify that you have specified the correct
label name and that you are in the correct database.


-8212	The security label component <component-name> is not defined
in the security policy.

Security labels can only contain values for those components that are
defined in the security policy of which the label is a part. The specified
security label component is not part of the security policy, so the
component cannot be used in that security label. Verify that you have
specified the correct component name and that you are in the correct
database.


-8213	The element <element-name> is not defined in the security label
component.

The component element does not exist in the definition of the security
label component. If you get this error when executing the scalar
function SECLABEL_BY_COMP(), then check the security label string
to make sure that the values are listed in the same order that the
components are listed in the security policy.


-8214	Two or more elements are specified for the security label
component <component-name>.

A security label cannot have multiple elements for a component of
type ARRAY. Specify only one element for the security label component.


-8215	The security label component element <element-name> was
specified more than once.

The security label component element was duplicated in the list of
elements of a security label component. Verify that you have specified
the security label component element name correctly.  Remove any
duplicates from the list of security label component elements.


-8216	The access rule <rule-name> does not exist in the rule set
used by the security policy.

The access rule specified in the GRANT EXEMPTION or REVOKE EXEMPTION
statement is not part of the LBAC rule set that is used by the
security policy. Specify an access rule that is part of the rule set
used by the specified security policy.


-8217	Cannot specify PUBLIC or a role name.

GRANT or REVOKE SECURITY LABEL or EXEMPTIONS to or from PUBLIC or a
role is not allowed. Specify an individual user name.


-8218	A DBSECADM cannot grant a privilege, security label or
exemption to self.

DBSECADM is not allowed to grant a privilege, security label, or
exemption to self. Ask another DBSECADM to perform this operation.


-8219	A DBSECADM cannot revoke a privilege, security label or
exemptions from self.

DBSECADM is not allowed to revoke a privilege, security label, or
exemption from self. Ask another DBSECADM to perform this operation.


-8220	User <user-name> does not hold this privilege, security label, 
or exemption.

The specified user does not hold this privilege, security label, or
exemption, so the revoke operation failed.


-8221	The security label <label-name> does not exist for the
security policy.

The specified security label does not exist for the security policy.
Verify that you have specified the correct security label name and
security policy name and that you are in the correct database.


-8222	User already has a security label <label-name> for READ access.

Each user can have at most one security label for READ access and at
most one for WRITE access. A security label has already been granted
to the user for READ access. If you want to change the user's security
label for READ access, you must first use the REVOKE SECURITY LABEL
statement to revoke the security label from the user.


-8223	User already has a security label <label-name> for WRITE access.

Each user can have at most one security label for READ access and at
most one for WRITE access. A security label has already been granted
to the user for WRITE access. If you want to change the user's security
label for WRITE access, you must first use the REVOKE SECURITY LABEL
statement to revoke the security label from the user.


-8224	The security label <label-name> conflicts with the existing
granted security label.

If the user is granted two distinct labels, one for READ access and
another for WRITE access, they must satisfy the following rules:

    *  For security label components of type ARRAY, the value must be
       the same in both security labels.

    *  For security label components of type SET, the values given in
       the security label used for WRITE access must be a subset of
       the values given in the security label used for READ access.

    *  For security label components of type TREE, either the values
       must be the same, or the values given in the security label
       used for WRITE access must be one of the sub tree values of
       the security label used for READ access.


-8225	The security label component <component-name> is currently in use.

The security label component cannot be dropped because one or
more security policies refer to it. The following query can be used
find all the security policies that refer to this security label
component:

         SELECT SECPOLICYNAME  FROM SYSSECPOLICIES
             WHERE SECPOLICYID = (SELECT  SECPOLICYID FROM
                                  SYSSECPOLICYCOMPONENTS
             WHERE COMPID = (SELECT COMPID FROM SYSSECLABELCOMPONENTS
             WHERE COMPNAME = "<component-name>"))


-8226	The security label <policy-name.label-name> is currently in use.

The security label could not be dropped because:

    *  It is granted to one or more users. Revoke this security label from
       all users who have been granted this security label for this
       security policy. The following query can be used to find all
       the users who have been granted with this security label.

         SELECT GRANTEE FROM SYSSECLABELAUTH
             WHERE READSECLABELID = (SELECT SECLABELID FROM SYSSECLABELNAMES
             WHERE SECLABELNAME = "<label-name>"    AND
                   SECPOLICYID = (SELECT SECPOLICYID FROM SYSSECPOLICIES
             WHERE SECPOLICYNAME = "<policy-name>")) OR
                   WRITESECLABELID = (SELECT SECLABELID FROM SYSSECLABELNAMES
             WHERE SECLABELNAME = "<label-name>"    AND
                   SECPOLICYID = (SELECT SECPOLICYID FROM SYSSECPOLICIES
             WHERE SECPOLICYNAME = "<policy-name>"))

    *  It is being used to protect one or more columns. For all the
       tables that use this security label to protect a column, either
       alter the table to drop this column protection or drop the table.
       The following query can be used to find all protected tables and
       all the columns that are protected with this security label.

         SELECT TABNAME, COLNAME FROM SYSCOLUMNS, SYSTABLES
             WHERE SYSCOLUMNS.TABID = SYSTABLES.TABID   AND
                   SECLABELID = (SELECT SECLABELID FROM SYSSECLABELNAMES
             WHERE SECLABELNAME = "<label-name>"        AND
                   SECPOLICYID = (SELECT SECPOLICYID FROM SYSSECPOLICIES
             WHERE SECPOLICYNAME = "<policy-name>"))


-8227	The security policy <policy-name> is currently in use.

The security policy could not be dropped because:

    *  It is being used to protect one or more tables. For all the
       tables that use this security policy, either alter the table to
       drop this table protection or drop the table. The following
       query can be used to find all the tables protected by this policy:

         SELECT TABNAME FROM SYSTABLES
             WHERE SECPOLICYID= (SELECT SECPOLICYID FROM SYSSECPOLICIES
             WHERE SECPOLICYNAME = "<policy-name>" )

    *  There are one or more security labels that use it. Drop all the
       security labels that are part of this security policy. The
       following query can be used find all security labels that belong
       to this security policy:

         SELECT SECLABELNAME FROM SYSSECLABELS
             WHERE SECPOLICYID=(SELECT  SECPOLICYID FROM SYSSECPOLICIES
             WHERE SECPOLICYNAME = "<policy-name>" )

    *  There are one or more exemptions granted on one or more of its
       rules. Revoke all exemptions granted for this security policy from
       all users. The following query can be used to find all users that
       have been granted exemptions for this policy:

        SELECT GRANTEE, EXEMPTION FROM SYSSECPOLICYEXEMPTIONS
            WHERE SECPOLICYID=(SELECT  SECPOLICYID FROM SYSSECPOLICIES
            WHERE SECPOLICYNAME = "<policy-name>")


-8228	Cannot GRANT or REVOKE SETSESSIONAUTH privilege to or from PUBLIC.

To grant or revoke SETSESSIONAUTH privilege to or from PUBLIC is not
allowed. Specify an individual user or role name.


-8229	User <user-name> does not have SETSESSIONAUTH privilege.

Only users holding SETSESSIONAUTH privilege can perform SET SESSION
AUTHORIZATION operation. Ask the DBSECADM to grant the privilege.


-8230	User <user-name> does not have the authority to grant or
revoke DBSECADM.

Only the DBSA has the authority to grant or revoke DBSECADM privilege.
Contact the DBSA to perform this operation.


-8231	DBSECADM cannot be granted to user <user-name>.

The GRANT statement attempted to grant DBSECADM to an authorization name that
is not allowed to receive that authority. The DBSECADM authority can only be
granted to an individual user.


-8232	The element <element-name> already exists in the security
label component.

During ALTER SECURITY LABEL COMPONENT, the security label component
element to be added to an existing component is already defined in that
security label component.


-8233	Cannot secure columns or rows in a table without a security policy.

A table cannot be protected with row or column level granularity
without associating a security policy with the table. The user should
add a security policy to the table using the SECURITY POLICY clause
of the CREATE TABLE statement or the ADD SECURITY POLICY clause of the
ALTER TABLE statement.


-8234	Invalid specification of a column <column-name> of type
IDSSECURITYLABEL.

For a column of type IDSSECURITYLABEL, the specification of an attribute
for the column is invalid because a column of type IDSSECURITYLABEL
cannot be encrypted or altered to a different data type. The column of
type IDSSECURITYLABEL also cannot have attributes like column protection,
single column contraints or be part of multiple column referential or
check contraints. The DEFAULT clause cannot be specified for the 
IDSSECURITYLABEL column in a CREATE TABLE statement. The DEFAULT clause
can be specified for the IDSSECURITYLABEL column only in an ALTER TABLE 
statement. The default value provided will only be applied to existing rows 
in the table.


-8235	A security policy cannot be added to a temporary, typed or 
external table.

Adding a security policy to a temporary, typed or external table is not
supported. Do not associate a security policy with a temporary or
external table.


-8236	Only one security label column is allowed in a table.

An attempt was made to create or alter a table with more than one
security label column. For a CREATE TABLE statement, declare only
one column to have the IDSSECURITYLABEL type. For an ALTER
TABLE statement, a column of type IDSSECURITYLABEL already exists.


-8237	Cannot modify column <column-name> to type IDSSECURITYLABEL.

An existing column cannot be modified to IDSSECURITYLABEL data type;
this data type is used only for the security label column to protect
data rows. To protect table with row-level granularity, add a new column
of type IDSSECURITYLABEL.


-8238	Source table must have the same security protection as target table.

The security protection on the tables is not identical. The tables are
protected by different security policies or the set of security labels
protecting columns in the source table is not identical to that of target
table. The two tables must have the same secuirty policy, same protection
granularity, have the same set of protected columns, and each
pair of corresponding columns must be protected with same security label.


-8239	The table <table-name> already has a security policy.

A table can have at most one security policy attached to it. Do not try
to associate another security policy with the table before you have
dropped the association of the table with its current security policy.


-8240	The table <table-name> is not protected with a security policy.

A security policy cannot be dropped from a table that is not protected
with a security policy.


-8241	The column <column-name> has already been protected by a
security label.

The specified column is already protected by a security label. Do not
add another security label for protecting the column.


-8242	The column <column-name> is not protected by a security label.

Column security cannot be dropped from a column that is not protected by
a secuirty label.


-8243	User <user-name> does not hold a security label for READ access.

To execute the built-in function SECLABEL_TO_CHAR, the user must have a
security label for READ access of the security policy. Ask the DBSECADM
to grant a security label for READ access.


-8244	The value <column-value> provided for row security label column
is invalid.

An INSERT or UPDATE statement specified a value for a column of type
IDSSECURITYLABEL. The value corresponds to a null label or cannot be
converted to a valid security label for the security policy that is
protecting the table. Check the INSERT or UPDATE statement and make
sure that the value being set in the security label column is valid
for the security policy protecting the table.  Sometimes an invalid
value can be generated as a result of a SELECT statement done from a
table that is not protected with the same security policy as the target
table. You should only copy security labels between tables protected by
the same security policy.


-8245	User cannot perform READ access to the protected column
<column-name>.

While accessing the table protected by a security policy, the user
is attempting SELECT, DELETE, or UPDATE access on the column. The user
does not have the LBAC credentials necessary to read the column.
Ask the DBSECADM to grant the user the LBAC credentials that allow
READ access to the column.


-8246	User cannot perform WRITE access to the protected column
<column-name>.

While accessing the table protected by a security policy, the user
is attempting INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE access on column. The user
does not have the LBAC credentials necessary to update the column.
Ask the DBSECADM to grant the user the LBAC credentials that allow
WRITE access to the column.


-8247	User does not have the LBAC credentials to perform INSERT
on table <table-name>.

The user is not allowed to perform INSERT on the table. A user is
not allowed to insert a row into a protected table if the user does
not have appropriate security label or exemption credentials. Ask the
DBSECADM to grant the user the proper security label or exemptions
required to perform insert operation.


-8248	User does not have the LBAC credentials to perform SELECT
on table <table-name>.

The user is not allowed to perform SELECT on the table. A user is
not allowed to select rows in a protected table if the user does
not have appropriate security label or exemption credentials. Ask the
DBSECADM to grant the user the proper security label or exemptions
required to perform select operation.


-8249	User does not have the LBAC credentials to perform UPDATE
on table <table-name>.

The user is not allowed to perform UPDATE on the table. A user is
not allowed to update a row in a protected table if the user does
not have appropriate security label or exemption credentials. Ask the
DBSECADM to grant the user the proper security label or exemptions
required to perform update operation.


-8250	User does not have the LBAC credentials to perform DELETE
on table <table-name>.

The user is not allowed to perform DELETE on the table. A user is
not allowed to delete a row from a protected table if the user does
not have appropriate security label or exemption credentials. Ask the
DBSECADM to grant the user the proper security label or exemptions
required to perform delete operation.


-8251	Update, delete, or insert into a UNION ALL view is not allowed.

Updates, deletes, and inserts are not allowed into a UNION ALL view
if that view is created on one or more protected tables. If you have
sufficient credentials, perform the DML operation on the base table,
rather than on the UNION ALL view.


-8252	Cannot set role to DBSECADM.

DBSECADM is a system defined role. SET ROLE statement can only be
used with user created roles.


-8253	Cannot open database <database-name>.

The database server cannot find the specified database. To find the names of
all databases, query sysmaster:sysdatabases.


-8254	Database <database-name> is currently opened by another user.

Another user has opened the specified database in exclusive mode. Repeat
the statement after a short delay or when the database is known to be idle.


-8255	User <user-name> does not have DBSA authority.

User does not have the necessary permission to perform the operation;
only DBSA has the authority to perform this operation. Contact the
DBSA to perform this operation.


-8256	Invalid character in element <element-name>.

The security label component element has an invalid character. The element
name cannot include parentheses, comma, or colon characters: ( ), :


-8257	The security label component element <element-name> cannot be null.

The security label component element specified is null. The element name
should be a non-null quoted character string.


-8258	The rule specified is not consistent with the security policy
<policy-name>.

The rule specified is not consistent with the security policy.


-8259	Cannot GRANT or REVOKE SETSESSIONAUTH privilege for role.

To grant or revoke SETSESSIONAUTH privilege for role is not allowed.
Specify an individual user or PUBLIC.


-8260	Multiple security policy clauses.

The security policy clause has been specified more than once. Either
ADD or DROP SECURITY POLICY was specified more than once or a combination
of ADD and DROP SECUIRTY POLICY was specified. Change the statement to
so that it has only one ADD or DROP SECURITY POLICY clause.


-8261	Cannot secure rows in a table without a default value for the
IDSSECURITYLABEL column.

A non-empty table cannot be protected with row-level granularity
without specifying a default value for the IDSSECURITYLABEL column.
Change the ALTER TABLE statement to specify the DEFAULT clause for
the IDSSECUIRTYLABEL column.


-8262	Cannot update partition flags.

This internal error indicates the database server could not update
partition flags to set or unset table protection. Check the accompanying
ISAM error code for more information.


-8263	The component type specified <component-type> does not match the type 
in the system catalog.

The security label component type specified in ALTER SECURITY LABEL COMPONENT
statement does not match the type of this component in the system catalog.


-8264	Cannot alter ARRAY security label component to add elements before 
<element-name>.

You cannot add more elements before the specified element because too many
alters have been performed on the ARRAY security label component. You can add
elements before or after other elements in the security label component.


-8265	Cannot alter ARRAY security label component to add elements after 
<element-name>.

You cannot add more elements after the specified element because too many
alters have been performed on the ARRAY security label component. You can add
elements before or after other elements in the security label component.


-8266	Operation not permitted.

This operation is an internal command that you are not permitted to use.


-8267	Cannot add LBAC protection to a table defined for replication.

The specified operation cannot be performed on a table if replication
is defined on the table. LBAC is not supported with Enterprise Replication.


-8268	Cannot create a distinct type <type-name> of type IDSSECURITYLABEL.

The statement specified creation of a distinct data type as IDSSECURITYLABEL.
A IDSSECURITYLABEL data type cannot be a distinct type. Remove DISTINCT from 
the statement or specify a different data type.


-8269	LBAC internal error: <internal-error> 

If this internal error recurs, note all circumstances and
contact GBase Technical Support.


-8270	Row security label for a protected table cannot be null.

To insert data into a row protected table either user should have LBAC 
security label or the user has to explicitly specify a row security label. 


-8300	The specified sequence object <sequence-name> is not in the database.

The database server cannot find the sequence object specified in the
statement. The sequence object might have been renamed or dropped from
the database.

Check the names of sequence objects in the statement. If the names are
spelled as you intended, check that you are using the database you want.
To find the names of all sequence objects, query the syssequences table.


-8301	Sequence <sequence-name> already exists in the database.

This statement tries to create a table or sequence object with the name
that is shown, but a sequence object with that name already exists.
Only one table or sequence object with a given name can exist in a single
database. (In an ANSI-compliant database, the name of the user that created
a table or sequence object name qualifies it, so one table or sequence 
object of a given name per user can exist.)

Check the spelling of the name; if it is as you intended, and you are
sure it should not exist, check that you are using the right database.
You can review the names of all tables and sequence objects in this
database by querying systables as follows:

SELECT tabname FROM systables WHERE tabid > 99


-8302	A Sequence object definition value is invalid or out of range.

A non-integral or out-of-range value has been specified in the sequence
object's definition in the CREATE SEQUENCE or ALTER SEQUENCE statements.
The sequence object's definition parameters include its START/RESTART
value, INCREMENT value, MAXVALUE, and MINVALUE.

Check that the values specified for the sequence object's definition
parameter are integral and in the range (-2e63 + 1) or
-9,223,372,036,854,775,807 and (+2e63 -1) or 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.


-8303	Duplicate or conflicting (%s) specification in sequence definition.

A duplicate or conflicting specification for sequence object definition
parameters has been found in the CREATE SEQUENCE or ALTER SEQUENCE
statements.

Conflicting specifications include combination of MAXVALUE-NOMAXVALUE,
MINVALUE-NOMINVALUE, CACHE-NOCACHE, ORDER-NOORDER, and CYCLE-NOCYCLE.

Check whether any sequence definition parameters have been specified more than
once or if both the conflicting parameters have been specified.


-8304	MAXVALUE cannot be less than MINVALUE.

You cannot set the MAXVALUE of the sequence object to less than its
MINVALUE.


-8305	INCREMENT 0 is not allowed in sequences.

You cannot specify an INCREMENT value of 0 for sequence objects. The
INCREMENT value has to be a non-zero integral value.


-8306	CACHE size should be in the range of 1 to 2,147,483,647.

The number of cached values of a sequence object has to be in the range of 1
to 2,147,483,647.

Use NOCACHE parameter specification to specify a cache size of 0.


-8307	CACHE size should be less than one cycle. The default CACHE size is 20.

The number of cached values of a sequence object cannot be greater than
the number of values generated in single cyclic sequence. The
default number of cached values is 20.

Check whether the number of cached values is less than 20 and no cache parameter
has been specified in the sequence object definition. If so, specify an
appropriate value for CACHE parameter. Use NOCACHE parameter specification
to specify a cache size of 0.


-8308	Cannot set START value less than MINVALUE or greater than MAXVALUE.

You cannot set a sequence object to start at a value less than its MINVALUE
or greater than its MAXVALUE.

Check the statement and modify the range MINVALUE-MAXVALUE or set an
appropriate START value in this range.


-8309	Cannot RESTART the sequence at a value less than MINVALUE or greater
than MAXVALUE

You cannot set a sequence object to restart at a value less than its
MINVALUE or greater than its MAXVALUE.

If you are attempting to restart the sequence, check to see that the
RESTART value is in the range MINVALUE-MAXVALUE. If not, either alter the
MINVALUE-MAXVALUE parameters or set an appropriate value to restart from.
If you are attempting to alter either or both MINVALUE and MAXVALUE
parameters, check to see whether a restart value has already been set for the sequence
that does not lie in the altered MINVALUE-MAXVALUE range. To
find an existing set restart value, query the syssequences table.


-8310	MINVALUE cannot be set to exceed current value.

You cannot alter the sequence definition to set the MINVALUE greater than the
current value of the sequence object. The current value of the sequence
object is the value generated on last NEXTVAL reference.

If you have already initialized the sequence in your session, you may
compare the CURRVAL of your session with the MINVALUE in the statement.
However, the CURRVAL of your session may not be in sync with the current
value of the sequence object, as there may be other sessions generating
numbers from the sequence object. You can set and check the current value
of the sequence object by generating a number with a NEXTVAL reference.


-8311	MAXVALUE cannot be set to be lesser than the current value.

You cannot alter the sequence definition to set MAXVALUE less than the
current value of the sequence object. The current value of the sequence
object is the value generated on the last NEXTVAL reference.

If you have already initialized the sequence in your session, you may
compare the CURRVAL of your session with the MAXVALUE in the statement.
However, the CURRVAL of your session may not be in sync with the current
value of the sequence object, as there may be other sessions generating
numbers from the sequene object. You can set and check the current value
of the sequence object by generating a number with a NEXTVAL reference.


-8312	No options specified for ALTER SEQUENCE.

The ALTER SEQUENCE statement has no parameters specified to be altered.
Specify the definition parameters you intend to alter and then run the
statement.


-8313	Sequence (%s) exceeds its MAXVALUE.

The specified sequence object cannot generate numbers because it has exceeded
its MAXVALUE.

If you have set a MAXVALUE for the sequence, you can alter it to a higher
value, up to (+2e63 -1) or 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. If the MAXVALUE is 
already set to this highest value, consider altering your sequence to be
a cyclic sequence to restart from the MINVALUE.


-8314	Sequence (%s) goes below its MINVALUE.

The specified sequence object cannot generate numbers because it has gone
below its MINVALUE.

If you have set a MINVALUE for the sequence, you can alter it to a lower
value, up to (-2e63 +1) or -9,223,372,036,854,775,807. If the MINVALUE is
already set to this lowest value, consider altering your sequence to be
a cyclic sequence to restart from the MAXVALUE.


-8315	Sequence (%s) CURRVAL is not yet defined in this session.

You cannot get the session CURRVAL because the sequence object has not been
initialized in this session. The session CURRVAL is the value generated
on a previous call to the sequence object's NEXTVAL.

If the sequence object has been renamed using RENAME SEQUENCE, you will
need to reinitialize the sequence object in your session.

Run a NEXTVAL first to define a CURRVAL for the sequence object in your
session.


-8316	Cannot rename a sequence object using a synonym.

You cannot perform a rename operation on a sequence object using a synonym.
Specify the <sequence-name> instead.

If you intend to rename the synonym, then drop the existing synonym and
create a new one.


-8317	A sequence object cannot appear in the FROM clause.

A sequence object cannot appear in the FROM clause. To generate a number
from the sequence object use:

    SELECT <sequence-name>.[NEXTVAL|CURRVAL] from <table-name>;

A DELETE operation is not allowed on sequence objects.


-8318	This action is not allowed on sequence object.

Only the following operations are allowed on sequence objects:

    SELECT <sequence-name>.[NEXTVAL|CURRVAL] from <table-name>;
    ALTER SEQUENCE
    DROP SEQUENCE
    RENAME SEQUENCE
    GRANT/REVOKE
    CREATE SYNONYM
    DROP SYNONYM

Check to see whether you have specified any operation that does not belong to this set.


-8319	Sequence object cannot be used here.

Cannot refer to sequence object's CURRVAL or NEXTVAL in the following cases:

    WHERE clause of a SELECT/DELETE statement
    a condition of CHECK constraint
    SELECT statement with DISTINCT operator, aggregate function, GROUP BY
    clause, ORDER BY clause and UNION, INTERSECT, or MINUS set operator
    a fragment expression of CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE
    a VIEW definition
    DEFAULT clause of CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE

Check to see whether you attempted any operation in this set.


-8320	Only SELECT and ALTER are valid priveleges for sequence objects.

Only a subset of Table level privileges are valid for sequence objects.
You can GRANT or REVOKE only SELECT and ALTER privileges.

Both these privileges can be granted with the WITH GRANT option.


-8321	Not owner of sequence object.

Only the owner of the table or a user who has Database Administrator
privileges can execute this statement, for example, to drop a sequence object.
Check that the statement names the sequence object you
intended. If it does, you will have to get its owner or a DBA to
execute this statement. To find out whom to contact, you can query the
system catalog as follows:

SELECT tabname, owner FROM systables WHERE tabid > 99;
SELECT username FROM sysusers WHERE usertype = 'D'


-8322	Remote sequences are not supported currently.

You cannot reference a sequence object on a remote database.

Check to see whether you have a reference of type:

    <dbname>@<remote-server>:<sequence-name>.[NEXTVAL|CURRVAL]


-8324	Serial foreign keys should not refer to serial unique keys.

Both the referencing and referenced columns in a referential relationship
are SERIAL columns or SERIAL8 columns or BIGSERIAL columns, which the 
database server does not allow.

Change the referencing columns to be of a nonserial data type.

-8328	Write failed. count rows unloaded (check ulimit or disk space).

After writing count lines of output to the unload file, an error
occurred trying to write the next line. Look for operating-system
messages that might give more information. Possible causes include a
full disk or a disk quota limit.

-8331	Invalid table or view name (%s) in the REFERENCING clause of the
CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE FUNCTION statement.

This error is generated from the CREATE TRIGGER statement when a routine
with the REFERENCING clause is called within the action statement with a 
mismatched table or view name.

The table or view name in the REFERENCING clause of the CREATE PROCEDURE or
CREATE FUNCTION statement should match the triggering table or view name.

-8332	Only NEW value of the column reference can be modified.

Neither the OLD correlation name nor the table or view name in the
REFERENCING clause can be specified in the left hand side of the LET
statement in the trigger routine body.

Example 1 of error:

        CREATE PROCEDURE testproc1()
        REFERENCING OLD as O NEW as N FOR T;
        ...
        LET O.column1 = <value>; --- error
        END PROCEDURE;

Example 2 of error:

	CREATE PROCEDURE testproc2()
	REFERENCING OLD as O NEW as N FOR T;
	...
	LET T.column1 = <value>; --- error
	END PROCEDURE;
	
-8333	Invalid invocation of the routine with referencing clause.

This error is returned in the following cases:

    * The routine was created with the REFERENCING clause but was not 
      executed from the trigger action statement.

    * The routine was created with the REFERENCING clause but was not 
      executed with the WITH TRIGGER REFERENCES clause.

    * The routine was NOT created with the REFERENCING clause and was 
      executed with the WITH TRIGGER REFERENCES clause.

    * The routine was created with the REFERENCING clause but was not 
      executed from the FOR EACH ROW trigger action statement.
      	
-8334	REFERENCING clause cannot be used in external routines.

For external routines, using the REFERENCING clause to access the OLD or 
the NEW values for the column(s) is not valid.

-8335	Usage of the Boolean function (%s) is not valid in this context.

The Boolean functions INSERTING, UPDATING, DELETING and SELECTING are valid
for procedures that are executed from trigger action statements.

These functions return 't' or 'f' depending on the trigger type.

For Example:

        Create trigger trig1 INSERT ON tab1
                for each row(execute procedure proc1());


        Create procedure proc1()

        define i integer;
        define u integer;
        if (INSERTING) then
                LET i = 1;
        end if
        if (UPDATING) then
                LET u = 1;
        end if

        end procedure;

Execution of the above example will set the variable i to 1 but will not set
u to 1 because the created trigger is an insert trigger.

-8336	Undefined symbol (%s).

The symbol is undefined in the current context. If the error is from CREATE
TRIGGER or CREATE PROCEDURE/FUNCTION with REFERENCING clause, check for the
misspelling of the OLD or NEW correlation variable names.

-8337	New value of column reference (%s) cannot be modified.

A trigger routine whose REFERENCING clause specifies a view cannot
modify the NEW value of any column in that view.

Example of error:

       CREATE VIEW View1 ...

       CREATE PROCEDURE testproc()
       REFERENCING OLD as O NEW as N FOR View1;
       ...
       LET N.column1 = <value>; --- error
       END PROCEDURE;

Here the REFERENCING clause of a trigger routine declares N as a correlation 
name for qualifying NEW values of columns in a view. The LET statement is not
valid, because a correlation name cannot qualify NEW column values on the left
side of LET expressions if the REFERENCING clause specified a view.

The syntax in this example is valid only for LET statements within trigger
routines that are invoked (in the FOREACH section of the action clause) by
an INSERT or UPDATE trigger on a table, but not for INSTEAD OF triggers on
views.

-8351	Function <funcname> Invalid input XML document or input XPATH string.

Explanation:The input XML document or XPATH string has illegal characters or
            the XML document is not well-formed or the XPATH string is not 
            correct.
Action:Supply valid input arguments to the function <funcname> which
       is a well-formed XML document or a valid XPATH string.
       For Example :
       select extractvalue(col2, '/customer/personnel/') from tab;
       The above example has an XPATH string with trailing '/' which is
       invalid XPATH string. The correct usage would be,
       select extractvalue(col2, '/customer/personnel') from tab;

-8352	Function <funcname> Empty input XML document.

Explanation:The input arguments, XML document, or XPATH string are passed
            as empty strings. For example:
            SELECT extract(col, '') FROM tab;
            SELECT extractvalue('', '') FROM tab;
Action:Supply valid input arguments to the function <funcname> which
       is a well-formed XML document or a valid XPATH string.

-8353	Function  <funcname>  NULL input XML document.

Explanation:The input XML document is passed as NULL.
Action:Supply a well-formed XML document as the input.

-8354	Function <funcname>  Exception received for ICU memory allocation.

Explanation:An exception was received while allocating memory for ICU data
            structures.
Action:Make sure that the system has enough memory to run the command.
       If the problem persists, contact Technical Support to resolve
       the problem.

-8355	Function <funcname>  Error parsing the input XML document.

Explanation:The input XML document for <funcname> is not a well-formed
            XML string. For example:
            SELECT idsxmlparse('<customer>John<customer>') from tab;
            The input XML string is not a well formed XML string in this
            case because it is missing a </customer> tag.
Action:Supply a well-formed XML document as the input.
       For example:
       SELECT idsxmlparse('<customer>John</customer>') from tab;

-8356	Function <funcname>  Returned multiple nodes for the query.

Explanation:The function <funcname> returned more than one node.
Action:Modify the function <funcname> so that only one node is returned.

-8357	Function <funcname>  Out of memory exception.

Explanation:The database server needed to allocate memory in order to
            process the query, but none was available.This error might reflect 
            a hardware limit, an operating-system configuration limit, or a
            temporary shortage of space.
Action:Try the query again after a delay. If it still fails, consult your
       system administrator. If possible, revise your query to join fewer
       tables, to order or group on fewer columns, or to operate in two or
       more separate statements. On DOS systems, exit to the operating-system 
       command line, free some disk space or reduce the complexity of your 
       program, and resubmit the program.If the problem persists, contact 
       Technical Support to resolve the problem.

-8358	Function <funcname>  Connection Open Failed.

Explanation: The open connection call failed while running the function
             <funcname>.

Explanation:The server was unable to allocate enough memory for allocating
            a temporary clob file while running the function <funcname>.
Action:Make sure that the system has enough memory to run the command.
       If the problem persists, contact Technical Support to resolve
       the problem.

-8360	Function <funcname>  Large Object spec init failed.

Explanation:The server failed to open large object specification init
            structure while running the function <funcname>.
Action:Make sure that the system has enough memory to run the command.
       If the problem persists, contact Technical Support to resolve
       the problem.

-8361	Function <funcname>  Failed to create a large object.

Explanation:The server failed to create a smart large object while running the
            function <funcname>.
Action:Make sure that the system has enough memory to run the command.
       If the problem persists, contact Technical Support to resolve
       the problem.

-8362	Function <funcname>  Failed to write to a large object.

Explanation:The server failed to write to an open smart large object while
            running the function <funcname>.
Action:Make sure that the system has enough memory to run the command.
       If the problem persists, contact Technical Support to resolve
       the problem.

-8363	Function <funcname>  Null argument to function.

Explanation:One or more of the arguments that were passed to the function
            <funcname> is null.
Action:Contact Technical Support to resolve the problem.


-8364	Function <funcname>  Null buffer passed

Explanation:The state buffer that is used for storing XML output is null.
Action:Verify that system has enough memory.Contact Technical Support
       to resolve the problem.


-8365	Function <funcname>  Null row descriptor

Explanation:The row descriptor information in the argument was null.
Action:Contact Technical Support to resolve the problem.

-8366	Function <funcname>  Null type ID

Explanation:The row descriptor type ID is null.
Action:Contact Technical Support to resolve the problem.

-8367	Function <funcname>  Null type descriptor

Explanation:The descriptor of row descriptor type descriptor is null.
Action:Contact Technical Support to resolve the problem.

-8368	Function <funcname>  Buffer size exceeds maximum size

Explanation:The output of <funcname> must be less than 32739 bytes.
Action:If the combined size of output records exceeds 32739 bytes,
       one need to use a clob function.

-8369	Function <funcname> Memory allocation for internal buffer failed

Explanation:Function <funcname> was not able to allocate more memory.
Action:Make sure that the system has enough memory to run the command.
       If the problem persists, contact Technical Support to resolve
       the problem.

-8370	Function <funcname> init failed

Explanation:clob function <funcname> for init has failed.
Action:Contact Technical Support to resolve the problem.

-8371	Function <funcname> create failed

-8374	Function <funcname> write with seek failed

Explanation:clob function <funcname> for write with seek has failed.
Action:Contact Technical Support to resolve the problem.

-8375	Function <funcname> General exception.

Explanation:Function <funcname> received a general exception during execution.
Action:Contact Technical Support to resolve the problem.

-8376	Function <funcname> null input large object handle.

Explanation:A null input large object handle was passed as an input XML string
            for function <funcname>.
Action:Supply a valid smart large object handle.
       For example ,consider a table tab :
       create table tab(col1 int, col2 clob);
       Clob data can be inserted as,
       INSERT INTO tab values(1, filetoclob("data.xml", "client"));
       where "data.xml" is XML string document. The column tab.col2 can
       be used as input large object handle to function <funcname>.

-8377	Function <funcname> failed because the first argument is too long.

Explanation: The length of the first argument in the function is larger
than the maximum allowed length.
Action: Run the function again with a first argument that is less than or
equal to the maximum allowed length.

-8378	Function <funcname> failed because the second argument is too long.

Explanation: The length of the second argument in the function is larger
than the maximum allowed length.
Action: Run the function again with a second argument that is less than or
equal to the maximum allowed length.

-9001	Only columns of type CHARACTER may be subscripted or printed
without trailing blanks.

Either you attempted to subscript or apply the CLIPPED function to a
noncharacter variable, or you specified a variable to have the wrong
data type.


-9002	An unknown operation code was found in the PMIM.

An internal ACEGO error occurred. Make sure that a version of ACEPREP
at the same version level as ACEGO compiled your report. If that is the
case, recompile the report to make sure that the .arc file is not
corrupted. If the error recurs, note all circumstances and
contact GBase Technical Support.


-9003	A USING format string may contain only one '.'.

The format string that specifies the display of a number contains more
than one decimal point. Remove all but one of the decimal points. Refer
to the discussion of the USING function in the reference manual.


-9004	The column name is not in the current table, or the user variable name
has not been defined.

The name that is shown cannot be related to either a column in a
database table or a defined variable. Check its spelling. If you meant
it to be a variable, add it in the DEFINE section. If you meant to name
a column in the database, check to see if the table was altered or its
columns were renamed.


-9014	Usage: SACEGO [-q][-d database] report-filename.

Flags:

-q   SACEGO will not print any messages or errors.

-d   SACEGO will use the database name that follows the -d option instead of
     the database name that is specified in the DATABASE section of the
     report specification.

This message displays when ACEGO is not given appropriate command-line
arguments. Other messages might explain it explicitly. You can use the
-s option, as the manual describes, in place of -q as shown in the
message; they have the same effect.


-9025	The column name is not in the current table. Any column used as an
ORDER BY column must be in the current table.

The name that is displayed appears after the words ORDER BY, but it is
not the name of a column or the display label of an expression that is
selected in this statement.


-9046	The report output file filename could not be opened.  This is probably
due to permissions.

The report was directed to the destination shown, either with a REPORT
TO statement or through the contents of the DBPRINT environment
variable. Make sure that the destination was spelled correctly. Verify
that your account has operating-system permissions to write the
destination file and that the destination disk is writable and not
full.


-9047	The output file filename could not be created.

Probably your account does not have write permission in that directory,
the disk is full, or you have exceeded a limit on open files.


-9048	The pipe pipe-specification could not be opened.

The report was directed to the pipe that is shown in the REPORT TO
statement. Make sure that all program names in it are spelled
correctly, that the programs exist, and that they are on the current
execution path. Look for other messages from the operating system that
might indicate the source of trouble (for example, a message that
indicates not enough system memory was available).


-9049	A value entered as a command line parameter cannot be converted to the
data type type.

A PARAMETER statement in the DEFINE section defines one of the values
from the command line as having data type type. However, the value that
is given on the command line cannot be converted to that type. Check
the following points:

    *   If type is numeric, check that the parameter can be read as a
        number.

    *   If type is MONEY, the parameter should nevertheless not include
	a currency symbol.

    *   If type is CHARACTER or VARCHAR, check that the parameter is
	not longer than the length that is defined for the variable.

    *   If type is DATETIME, check that the parameter is correctly
        punctuated (refer to the information on DATETIME and INTERVAL
        data in the user guide).

    *   If type is DATE, check that the parameter is correctly
	punctuated as a date.

Correctly punctuated DATE, DATETIME and INTERVAL values contain
characters that might have special meaning to the operating system. The
problem might be that the parameter was correct but needed quotes
around it to protect it.


-9050	The user variable name is of type type. The value entered is out of
range or cannot be converted to that type.

A value was entered in response to a PROMPT statement, which stores the
value in a variable of the name and type shown. However, it was
impossible to convert the entered value to the data type of the
variable (see the discussion of error -9049 for details on conversion).
Rerun the report and enter appropriate data (also consider revising
the prompt string to better guide the user).


-9051	The number of defined parameters in the ACE program does not equal the
number of actual parameters passed to ACEGO on the command line.

The number of parameters that are defined using PARAMETER statements in
the DEFINE section does not agree with the number of items that are
given as parameters on the command line. Check that parameters that
contain spaces or other special characters are enclosed in quotes; the
lack of quotes can cause a single parameter to be taken as more than
one.


-9052	The format string is too large. It may not be larger than 79 characters.

A limit exists on the size of the format string that is presented to
the USING function.


-9053	An unknown entry in the .arc file has been detected. Recompile your ACE
report specification using SACEPREP and then rerun SACEGO. Be certain that the
version numbers for SACEPREP and SACEGO are identical.

The versions of ACEPREP and ACEGO must agree. (To check the version of
either program, run it from the command line with the -v option.) To
recompile the report, use a version of the compiler, ACEPREP, that is
identical to the version of the runner, ACEGO. If the versions are
already the same, recompile the report anyway to ensure that the .ace
file has not been corrupted. If the error recurs, note all
circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-9054	The ACE report was compiled by version A compiler. This runner can only
run 5 through B. Recompile your ACE report specification using SACEPREP and
then rerun SACEGO.

The versions of ACEPREP and ACEGO must agree. (To check the version of
either program, run it from the command line with the -v option.) To
recompile the report, use a version of the compiler, ACEPREP, that is
identical to the version of the runner, ACEGO. If the versions are
already the same, recompile the report anyway to ensure that the .ace
file has not been corrupted. If the error recurs, note all
circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-9055	The compiled report file filename could not be found or opened.

The report filename was named on the ACEGO command line. It expects to
locate the file filename.arc in the current directory or a path that
the DBPATH environment variable names, but it could not find the file
or could not open it for reading. Check that the filename was spelled
correctly and that your account has read access to it.


-9059	A select statement which is not the final select statement in an ACE
report must select into a temporary table.

The SELECT section of the report can contain more than one SELECT
statement. However, only the last one of these statements can produce
the rows that are the report contents. The preceding SELECT statements
are used to prepare data in temporary tables that the final statement
delivers to the report. Change the report specification so that all but
the last SELECT statement contain INTO TEMP clauses.


-9060	The values m and n used to subscript name are outside the bounds for
the column's defined length.

A column substring in the ORDER BY clause is incorrect. When taking a
substring of a column, the first number in brackets specifies the
position of the first character, and the second number specifies the
position of the last character of the substring. Both numbers must be
at least 1 and not greater than the total length of the column or
variable.


-9061	A 'SELECT INTO' statement cannot be executed as the last select
statement in an ACE report.

The SELECT section of the report can contain more than one SELECT
statement. The last (or only) one of these statements must produce the
rows that are the contents of the report. Any preceding SELECT
statements are used to prepare data in temporary tables that the final
statement delivers to the report. Change the report specification so
that all but the last SELECT statement contain INTO TEMP clauses.


-9062	An error has occurred during the conversion of a numeric value to a
CHARACTER type user variable. The CHARACTER type variable is not long enough
to hold the result.

The conversion of a numeric value to character produced more numeric
characters than the destination could hold. Rather than truncate the
result, ACEGO stops with an error. You can either redefine the
destination variable, or you can limit the size of the converted value
(for example, with a USING format string).


-9063	The user function name, defined by the user in the DEFINE statement
of ACE, could not be found in the C function definition table userfuncs in the
user's C static data area.

The DEFINE section of the report contains a FUNCTION statement
indicating that an external function name would be linked with the
report. (The ESQL/C manual covers the use of external C functions with
ACE reports and PERFORM screens.) However, the name and address of each
such function must appear in a static array that is named userfuncs.
That array, along with the computer code of the external functions, is
linked with a custom version of ACEGO. Because name did not appear in
the array, ACEGO cannot call it.

Check that you are executing the correct, customized version of ACEGO
(the original version of the program has no external functions linked
to it). Check to see if name is correctly spelled. Then examine the
source of the C functions to make sure that the userfuncs array is
defined correctly and that it contains an entry for name.


-9064	The run-time string table is full. No more memory can be allocated.

The data space available for temporary character strings is full.
Temporary strings are built when calling external C functions and when
processing the USING, SPACE, and ASCII built-in functions. Reduce the
use of these items.


-9065	Memory allocation has failed.

ACEGO was unable to allocate memory to hold a row, a line, or an SQL
data structure. The space needed is not (as the message text suggests)
directly related to the size of the report specification. The report
lacks only a few thousand bytes, at most, to run.


-9066	An error has occurred while writing to the output report.

The report destination was opened correctly, but the operating system
reported an error while output was being written. Look for error
messages from the operating system that explain the problem. The most
common cause of the error is lack of available disk space.


-9067	ACEs arithmetic stack has exceeded its bounds. The expression here is
too complicated.

Reduce the complexity of the arithmetic expression. For example, divide
the expression into subexpressions and assign the values of each to a
variable.


-9068	An SQL statement has been found in the SELECT section that is not a
SELECT statement. Only SELECT statements or SELECT statements that create
temporary tables are allowed in the SELECT section.

Possibly the word SELECT is misspelled in the report specification. If
you intentionally wrote another SQL statement such as UPDATE or INSERT,
remove it; only SELECT statements are permitted in reports. (You can
execute other SQL statements in a C function that is called from a
report. The ESQL/C manual discusses linking external C functions with
reports.)


-9070	A record in the flat ascii input file contains more data fields than
what was specified in the DEFINE ASCII statement of the report.

A field in the ASCII file is a sequence of zero or more characters that
ends in a delimiter character (the delimiter is specified in the READ
statement). Effectively, as many fields as delimiter characters exist
in each record. The number of fields must be the same in each record,
and each field must be defined in an ASCII statement in the DEFINE
section of the report. Extra fields are not ignored. Look for message
-9072; it can help you locate the record in error.


-9071	A record in the flat ascii input file contains less data fields than
what was specified in the DEFINE ASCII statement of the report.

A field in the ASCII file is a sequence of zero or more characters that
ends in a delimiter character (the delimiter is specified in the READ
statement). Effectively, as many fields as delimiter characters exist
in each record. The number of fields must be the same in each record,
and each field must be defined in an ASCII statement in the DEFINE
section of the report. No default exists for missing fields. Look for
message -9072; it can help you locate the record in error.


-9072	The count records from the ascii input file have been read in.

This informational message helps you locate the source of a problem in
the ASCII input file. The problem that is described in another message
was found in the count line of the file.


-9140	An attempt was made to divide by zero on line number.  The result was
set to zero.

An expression on line number of the report-specification file contains
a division operation. At some point in the report run, the divisor in
the expression was zero. Examine the expression and the data it uses
and write the report so that division by zero will not occur (for
example, by testing for zero in an IF statement). This error can result
from applying an aggregate function to a defined variable before the
first row of data is processed. To avoid this situation, make sure that
any variable has a value before it is used (for example, by setting it
from a command-line parameter or with a PROMPT FOR statement).


-9142	Date conversion error.

ACEGO is trying to convert from characters into a DATE data type but
found an error. Either the date is not punctuated correctly, unwanted
nonnumeric characters are present, or the date itself is inconsistent
(for example, "01/32/91").


-9143	Character, Text, and Byte data cannot be printed with using formats.

The USING function can only be applied to numeric data. Revise the
report specification.


-9200	Purpose routine (am_xxx) is not yet supported with JVTI.

Your JVTI code included a purpose method that is not supported
in this release. am_xxx can be any of the following unsupported 
methods: am_delete, am_insert, am_update, am_check, am_truncate,
or am_stats.


-9201	Secondary access method with Java am_purpose routine is not
supported.

You attempted to create a secondary access method with Java-Language User
Defined Routines. Secondary access methods are not supported in Java
technology. 

To create a secondary access method, you must use the C language User Defined
Routines. For more information, see the Virtual-Index Interface Programmer's
Guide.


-9202	JVTI only supports external am_sptype in this release.

Your CREATE PRIMARY ACCESS_METHOD SQL statement specified an am_sptype
value other than "X". JVTI allows you to address only extspace (not sbspace
or dbspace) data storage.

 Use the ALTER ACCESS_METHOD SQL statement to change am_sptype to 'X'.


-9250	Xadatasource type datasource_type_name already exists in database.

The xadatasource type that you are creating with CREATE XADATASOURCE TYPE
statement already exists. You must use a new name.


-9251	Xadatasource datasource_name already exists in database.

The xadatasource that you are creating with a CREATE XADATASOURCE 
datasource_name USING statement already exists. You must use a new name.


-9252	Xadatasource type datasource_type_name not found.

The datasource_type_name you are trying to drop with DROP XADATASOURCE 
TYPE datasource_type_name statement does not exist. Use the correct 
datasource_type_name.


-9253	Xadatasource datasource_name not found.

The datasource_name DROP XADATASOURCE datasource_name does not exist. 
Use the correct name.


-9254	Improper purpose function used for xadatasource type.

A purpose routine used with the CREATE XADATASOURCE TYPE type_name statement 
is improper. It might be spelled incorrectly. Otherwise, it is used 
incorrectly in combination with the other purpose routines, or it is a purpose 
routine is not appropriate for the xadatasource type. Correct the spelling 
of the purpose routine or change one or more of the purpose routines until the 
combination of purpose routines is valid.

Example:  CREATE XADATASOURCE TYPE xads_t1(
             xa_flags    = 1,
             xa_version  = 0,
             xa_open     = xa2pc_open,
             xa_start    = xa2pc_start,
             xa_close    = xa2pc_close,
             xa_end      = xa2pc_end,
             xa_rollback = xa2pc_rollback,
             xa_prepare  = xa2pc_prepare,
             xa_commit   = xa2pc_commit,
             xa_recover  = xa2pc_recover,
             xa_forget   = xa2pc_forget,
             xa_complete = xa2pc_complete);


-9255	Duplicate purpose function used for xadatasource type.

A purpose routine used with the CREATE XADATASOURCE TYPE datasource_type_name 
statement has been used more than once. Change the purpose routines used until 
no duplicates exist.


-9256	Required purpose function is was not used for the xadatasource type.

A required purpose routine has not been used with the CREATE XADATASOURCE TYPE 
datasource_type_name statement. Change the purpose routines used until the 
required purpose routines are included or preserved.

Example:  CREATE XADATASOURCE TYPE xads_t1(
             xa_flags    = 1,
             xa_version  = 0,
             xa_open     = xa2pc_open,
             xa_start    = xa2pc_start,
             xa_close    = xa2pc_close,
             xa_end      = xa2pc_end,
             xa_rollback = xa2pc_rollback,
             xa_prepare  = xa2pc_prepare,
             xa_commit   = xa2pc_commit,
             xa_recover  = xa2pc_recover,
             xa_forget   = xa2pc_forget,
             xa_complete = xa2pc_complete);


-9257	Improper value used for purpose function for xadatasource type.

A purpose routine has been used with an improper value in a CREATE XADATASOURCE 
TYPE datasource_type_name statement. Use the proper type of value for 
the purpose routine.


-9258	Not an owner of xadatasource type or DBA.

The user executing a DROP XADATASOURCE TYPE statement is not authorized 
because the user is not the owner of the xadatasource type or does not 
have DBA privileges.


-9259	Not an owner of xadatasource or DBA.

The user executing a DROP XADATASOURCE statement is not authorized 
because the user is not the owner of the xadatasource type or does not 
have DBA privileges.


-9260	Cannot drop xadatasource type (type_name) that is still in use.

An xadatasource type cannot be dropped while it is in use. Be sure that no
xadatasource is defined using type_name.


-9261	Cannot drop xadatasource (name) that is still in use.

An xadatasource cannot be dropped while it is in use. Be sure that name
is currently not registered in the transaction.


-9262	Error [err] indicated by an xadatasource purpose function.

An error occurred when an attempt was made to execute an xadatasource purpose
routine. For more information, refer to the accompanying XA error code.


-9263	Can't execute CREATE/DROP XADATASOURCE statements in non logging database.

'CREATE XADATASOURCE TYPE', 'CREATE XADATASOURCE', 'DROP XADATASOURCE TYPE' and
'DROP XADATASOURCE' statements are for trasactional support for external 
datasources. Non logging databases do not support transactions and therefore
these statements cannot be executed in non logging database.

-9265	Invalid xadatasource name.

The xadatasource name passed as argument is invalid. The valid format for
the xadatasource name is 'xadatasourcename' or 'owner.xadatasourcename'. 


-9266	Not in a transaction.

The database server cannot register or unregister xadatasource instance
because no transaction is active in the current session. In order to register 
or unregister an xadatasource instance, you must start a transaction. 


-9267	Xadatasource name is not present in the database.

The xadatasource name is not present in the current database. Check the
name of the xadatasource; it might be spelled incorrectly. Otherwise
create the xadatasource name.


-9268	Xadatasource name is not registered in the transaction.

The xadatasource name is not registered in the transaction; xadatasource
has to be registered before it can be unregistered.


-9269	xa_open purpose function of xadatasource has returned an error.

The xa_open purpose function of xadatasource has returned an error. 
In order to register the xadatasource instance, xa_open needs to be 
Successful (i.e. it needs to return XA_OK).


-9270	Type <opaque_type_name> is unsupported in distributed queries.

The type <opaque_type_name> is unsupported in distributed queries.
The type  <opaque_type_name> cannot be used in queries that access more 
than one database.

Modify the query not to use the  <opaque_type_name> data type.


-9271	Type <opaque_type_name> is not identically defined in all the databases used in the distributed queries.

The attributes of the user-defined data type <opaque_type_name> are different
on the local and remote databases. A UDT used in a distributed queries must
have the same attributes  and type hierarchy in all databases accessed by 
the query.

Examine the definition of the <opaque_type_name> UDT in both your local and
remote databases. Modify one or both of the UDTs so that they are the same.

-9272	The data type <type_name> is not supported for current client/server configuration.

The data type <type_name> is not supported for current client version.
Modify the query not to use the <type_name> data type or upgrade client version

-9273	Cannot create duplicate table table-name.

In a non-ANSI database, table names must be unique. When two different users
create tables with the same name at the same time, one or both of the users can 
receive this message. Rerun the CREATE TABLE statement.

-9274	Complex type name length exceeds maximum allowd 65535.

The statement is trying to create complex type. The name of the complex type
is exceeds maximum allowed 65535. Modify the statement such that it uses 
smaller identifiers.

-9275	Decimal data precision exceeds the allowable limit for DRDA connections.

The query output contains decimal data that has precision exceeding the 
allowable limit of 31 digits for DRDA connections.

-9300	Cannot set clear flag for UDT (<udt-id>) in global jar list.

J/Foundation cannot set the clear flag for the specified user-defined
type in the global jar list.


-9301	Cannot set remove flag for jar (<jar-id>) in global JVP list.

J/Foundation cannot set the remove flag for the specified jar in the
global JVP list.


-9302	Cannot set new path flag for <identifier>.

J/Foundation cannot set a new path flag for the specified object.


-9303	User SQL Exception. <exception>

J/Foundation returned the specified SQL exception.


-9304	Updatable scroll cursor features are not supported in this
version.

The 9.21 database server does not support updatable scroll cursor
features. Attempts to use updatable scroll cursor methods like
updateRow(), insertRow(), or deleteRow() raise this error message.


-9305	Attempt to read or position past end of UDT data.

This error occurs when a Java user-defined routing (UDR) attempts to read
or set a position beyond the end of the user-defined type (UDT) data
available from a UDT data input stream.

Check the length and structure of the UDT carefully against the data
input UDR code.


-9400	User-defined aggregate <aggregate-name> already exists.

The name given already exists in your database, either as an aggregate name
or as the name of a routine. (You cannot have an aggregate and a routine
with the same name.)

Change your CREATE AGGREGATE statement to give the aggregate a unique name.


-9401	Cannot re-define or drop builtin aggregate <aggregate-name>.

The named aggregate is a system-defined aggregate. You can overload the
functions that support the built-in aggregates, but you cannot redefine
or drop built-in aggregates.

Create support functions for the named aggregate but do not use the CREATE
AGGREGATE statement.


-9402	Multiple occurrences of the <modifier-name> modifier.

Each of the modifiers INIT, ITER, COMBINE, FINAL, and HANDLESNULLS can
appear only once in the CREATE AGGREGATE statement. Check your statement
for repeated modifier names.


-9403	The <modifier-name> modifier must be specified.

You need to include the named modifier in your CREATE AGGREGATE statement.
The iterator (ITER) and combine (COMBINE) functions are required for all
user-defined aggregates.


-9404	User-defined aggregate <aggregate-name> does not exist.

The named aggregate does not exist in your database. Before you can use a
user-defined aggregate, you must create the necessary support functions and
register the new aggregate with a CREATE AGGREGATE statement.


-9405	Must be owner of user-defined aggregate <aggregate-name> or DBA.

You attempted to drop a user-defined aggregate that someone else created.
To drop a user-defined aggregate, you must own (be the creator of) the
aggregate or you must have DBA privilege.


-9406	Cannot resolve support function for user-defined aggregate
<aggregate-name>.

You attempted to use a built-in aggregate for which the database server
could not find an appropriate support function. For example, if you try
to use the SUM  aggregate on the "new_type" data type, the database server
looks for the following operator function:

     plus(new_type, new_type)

This error can also occur for a user-defined aggregate when one of the
support functions that the CREATE AGGREGATE statement has listed
(INIT/ITER/COMBINE/FINAL) is missing.

Make sure that you have the correct support functions for the user-defined
aggregate. These functions must be exist and must be registered in the
database with CREATE FUNCTION.


-9407	Set-up parameter to the aggregate <aggregate-name> cannot
contain non-group columns.

If the user-defined aggregate has been defined with a set-up argument, the
second argument of this aggregate must be either a constant or one of the columns in the GROUP BY clause of your query.

For example, the following two statements are valid:

    SELECT new_aggr(colA, 2) FROM some_table

    SELECT new_aggr(colA, colB) GROUP BY colB FROM some_table


-9408	User-defined aggregate <aggregate-name> has no arguments.

The user-defined aggregate in your SELECT statement does not specify any
arguments

Make sure that the user-defined aggregate of the SELECT statement 
provides the correct number of arguments (one or possibly two, if 
the aggregate includes a set-up argument).


-9409	User-defined aggregate <aggregate-name> has too many arguments.

The user-defined aggregate in your SELECT statement specifies too many
arguments

Make sure that the user-defined aggregate of the SELECT statement 
provides the correct number of arguments (one or possibly two, if 
the aggregate includes a set-up argument).


-9410	User-defined aggregate <aggregate-name> has two arguments but no
INIT function specified.

The user-defined aggregate in your SELECT statement specifies a set-up
argument. However, the CREATE AGGREGATE statement that defined this
aggregate has not specified an INIT support function. The handling of
a set-up argument must occur in an INIT function.

You can either call the user-defined aggregate without a set-up argument
or implement a set-up argument for the user-defined aggregate. To implement a set-up argument, take the following actions:

     -  Write an INIT support function that handles the set-up
        argument.
     -  Register the INIT function (with CREATE FUNCTION).

     -  Drop the user-defined aggregate (with DROP AGGREGATE).

     -  redefine the user-defined aggregate (WITH CREATE AGGREGATE),
        providing the INIT modifier to specify the new INIT support 
        function.


-9411	User-defined aggregate support function <function-name> does not
handle nulls.

You created your aggregate with the HANDLESNULLS option, but the function
named in the error message does not handle nulls.

When you create an aggregate with HANDLESNULLS, all support functions must
also handle nulls. You can either change the aggregate or change the
function. To change the aggregate, drop the aggregate and re-create it
without the HANDLESNULLS option.

If the aggregate needs to handle null values, you must modify the function so
that it can handle nulls. Then drop the function and reregister it with the
HANDLESNULLS option.


-9412	Return type of the support function <function-name> does not
match the aggregate state type.

When you extend a built-in aggregate for a user-defined data type, the
return type of the operator function must be the same as the data type
for which you are extending the aggregate. For example, if you try to use the SUM aggregate on the "new_type" data type, thedatabase server looks for a plus() function with the following signature: 

     CREATE FUNCTION plus(c1 new_type, c2 new_type)
            RETURNING new_type;

This error can also occur for user-defined aggregates if the  return type of
an INIT support function is not the same as that of the ITER or COMBINE
function. For user-defined types, make sure that the return types of the
INIT function (if any), ITER function, and COMBINE function are the same as the user-defined type.


-9422	JDK 1.2 cannot be used with kernel AIO.

JDK 1.2 cannot be used with kernel AIO.

of the JDK has been installed, or the installation has not been completed
correctly.


-9430	JNI internal error. Unable to find or execute JNI call
(<call-id>).

The specified JNI call could not be executed. Possible causes of this
error include invalid JVP ONCONFIG variable settings, a possible VM
crash, and VM corruption. For example, your JVPCLASSPATH ONCONFIG
parameter might be missing the $GBASEDBTDIR/extend/krakatoa/krakatoa.jar
file, or JVPCLASSPATH or another ONCONFIG parameter might have an incorrect
path or file name.

Check your JVP ONCONFIG variable settings. If the settings are valid,
contact GBase Technical Support.


-9431	Can't find system class or method or library (<identifier>).

Java startup failed to locate the system class or method (<identifier>).

Check the Java installation and J/Foundation installation on the
computer. Either the wrong version has been installed, or the
installation has not been completed correctly.

-9440	Server JDBC failed to open cursor.

An attempt to open a cursor fetch by server JDBC failed.


-9441	Cannot create UDR Thread (%s).

The Embedded Java Virtual Machine failed to create a thread for processing
the UDR call. Contact GBase Technical Support.


-9442	Error loading Java UDR class (%s).

Make the following checks to ensure that the class that contains the Java
UDR is loaded:
     o  The directory that contains the class must be specified in the 
        CLASSPATH environment variable.

     o  The jar that contains the class must be correctly installed with
        the built-in procedure install_jar().

     o  The jar file has been created correctly, with the proper path to the
        class.


-9443	Cannot find class for type (%s).

For a user-defined-type mapping, make sure that the class is present in the
CLASSPATH environment variable or in a jar that is installed in the
database. Mappings for other data types come from the Java Developer's Kit
(JDK) or GBase-enhanced classes. For these data types, check the
installation of your JDK and GBase server.


-9444	Initialization of Java virtual processor failed: (<processor>).

Possible causes for this error message include incorrect settings in
the configuration file for the database server, incorrect installation
of the JDK release, missing links to the JDK shared libraries,
and no gbasedbt.policy file.

Make sure that the configuration file for the database server has the
correct settings for J/Foundation. Also make sure that your JDK release
is properly installed. For Solaris systems that require /usr/lib links
to the JDK shared libraries, make sure that the links are properly
installed with the setjdk utility program.

If the gbasedbt.policy file is missing, copy the file
$GBASEDBTDIR/extend/krakatoa/gbasedbt.policy.std to
$GBASEDBTDIR/extend/krakatoa/gbasedbt.policy. You can customize
the gbasedbt.policy file after you create it.


-9445	Java language manager operation failed (%s).

Contact GBase Technical Support.


-9446	Execution of Java user-defined routine failed: (%s).

Make sure that the SQL and Java signatures that the CREATE FUNCTION or
CREATE PROCEDURE statement has provided specify the same number of
parameters.


-9449	Java UDR method not found or is not static: (%s).

Make sure that the specified Java method exists as a public static method in
the specified class. Also make sure that the signature of the defined method
matches the signature that the CREATE FUNCTION or CREATE PROCEDURE statement
has specified.


-9450	Java method invocation failed (%s).

Make sure that the Java method is accessible. That is, it must either be
public or be in the same package as the caller.


-9451	Error instantiating user-defined-type mapping class (%s).

Make sure that the Java class specified has the proper access permissions
for instantiation. Check the instantiation rules for the Java language.


-9452	Error processing null argument. Use Java object form of type (%s).

You have probably used a Java primitive type as an argument to a Java method
that maps to the specified Java UDR. A null value for a primative-type
argument is invalid. Replace the Java primitive type with a Java Object
type. For example, replace "int" with "java.lang.Integer".


-9453	The JDBC command doesn't return any rows.

The database server did not return any rows as a result of the JDBC command. 


-9454	Error getting length for user-defined type (<udt-type>).

deployment descriptor file.


-9483	Unrecognized type: (%s).

Make sure that the specified data type is registered in the current database.


-9484	Invalid jar name.

If the jar name specifies the database and/or username, make sure that these
names match the database and user in the environment in which the jar is
being installed.


-9485	Attempt to install an existing jar: (%s).

Remove the existing jar before you install a new one that has the same name.


-9486	Invalid URL.

Check the syntax of the URL for the jar.


-9487	Attempt to remove non-existing jar: (%s).

You cannot drop a jar that has not first been installed. 


-9488	Invalid jar removal. All dependent UDRs not dropped.

You cannot drop a jar if dependent UDRs still reference any of the classes
within the jar. Drop all user-defined functions and/or user-defined
procedures that reference a class in the jar within their external names.


-9489	Invalid jar replacement. Class (%s) from old jar is still
referenced.

There is at least one class in the old jar that is not replaced in the new
jar and is referenced by a Java UDR. You must either drop the Java UDR
before you attempt to replace the jar, or add the class to the new jar.


-9490	No manifest file found for jar (%s).

All deployment descriptions that install_jar() needs to process must be
listed in the manifest file for the jar. Make sure that the manifest file
is created correctly for the jav. If no deployment descriptors are to be
processed, pass a value of '0' as the last parameter to the install_jar() built-in procedure. 


-9491	User threads are not allowed in this context, must be a DBAThread.

Java threads created by users from within user-defined routines are not
allowed to open JDBC connections.

If such threads need to execute SQL statements, then they need to open Solano connections
to run the queries against.


-9492	Unsupported feature: (%s).

This version of the database server cannot implement the specified feature.


-9493	Unsupported command from deployment descriptor: (%s).

Check the J/Foundation documentation for the commands that the database server
supports within deployment descriptor files.


-9494	Java not supported in this database server or Error loading
Java language module.

The version of your database server might not be Java enabled.

If you are using a Java-enabled database server and the Java language
module $GBASEDBTDIR/extend/krakatoa/lmjava.so does not exist in your
distribution, contact GBase Technical Support.


-9495	Database server JDBC internal error. Check with your
administrator.

Unexpected JDBC driver internal error. This error is raised if 
the JDBC driver fails to acquire an internal resource.

For diagnostic information, check the jvp.log and online.log files.


-9496	Unable to map Java type to an SQL type or SQL type to a
Java type.

Unable to map between the Java type and the specified SQL type. This
error is usually raised when the database server is unable to start a
Java user-defined routine because its SQL types could not be mapped
to Java types.

Check the declaration of the Java user-defined routine.


-9498	Incorrect path to JAR file specified: (<pathname>).

The pathname for the JAR file to be installed is incorrect.

Correct the path to the JAR file and retry.


-9499	Internal JAR handling error. Check with your
administrator.

Unexpected JAR handling error.

For additional information, check the jvp.log and online.log files.


-9500	A subscript is out of bounds.

This statement takes a substring of a character variable. The substring
values (that is, two numbers in square brackets) are incorrect. The
first is less than zero or greater than the length of the column, or
the second is less than the first. Correct the form specification and
recompile.


-9503	The table tablename could not be opened.

Check that the table name is correctly spelled. If so, the table
tablename might not exist in the database (it might have been dropped
or renamed); or if it exists, your account might not have SELECT access
to it. Alternatively, if you are using the GBase SE database server,
you might have exceeded the limit on open files, which can limit the
number of tables that you can name in a SELECT statement. In this case,
you might have to revise the SELECT section of the report to use more
SELECT statements, each of which names fewer tables. Products after
Version 4.0 do not issue this message.


-9503	PRINT FILE filename could not be opened.

The file that is shown could not be opened for output. Look for
operating-system error messages that might give more information.
Possible causes include a full disk or lack of the correct permissions
for the file or directory.


-9504	The argument number is out of bounds for the ascii function. Arguments
must be between 0 and 255, inclusive.

The input to the ASCII function must be a number between 0 and 255.
Examine the use of this function in the report specification. If the
improper value number came from a command-line parameter, you might
consider testing it with an IF statement.

-9602	Illegal attempt to convert a collection type into another type.

You attempted to store a collection of one type in a collection of a
different type, or you attempted to move a collection into a host
variable that is not a collection. In ESQL/C, a collection host
variable declared to contain elements of a specific type can only hold
collections of that same type. If you require that a collection host
variable hold collections of different types, declare it without the
specific type information.


-9605	Scroll cursor can't select collection columns.

You attempted to select a collection column while you were using a
scroll cursor. You must rewrite the query without the scroll cursor or
eliminate any collection columns from the select list.


-9606	Collections are not allowed in the GROUP BY clause.

Move the reference to a collection column in the GROUP BY list.


-9607	Collections are not allowed in the DISTINCT clause.

Either remove the DISTINCT clause or remove the collection column
from the SELECT clause.


-9608	Collections are not allowed in the ORDER BY clause.

Remove the reference to a collection column in the GROUP BY list.


-9609	Collections are not allowed in the expression.

You attempted to select a collection from within a subquery, perform an
aggregation on a collection, or use a collection in some other
expression that is not allowed. Check your manual to determine
the places where you can use collections in expressions.


-9610	Illegal attempt to use collection host variable.

You attempted to calculate the cardinality of a data type that is not a
collection, incorrectly used a collection host variable by using an
untyped collection without assigning a value to it, or used incorrect
syntax to create a collection derived table.

Check your manual to determine the correct usage of collections in
this context.


-9611	ROM clause cannot have a join when one of the tables is a collection.

You cannot join a table derived from a collection with a table. Remove
TABLE(:coll_host_var) from the FROM clause of your query.


-9612	No WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING or ORDERBY clause is allowed in a collection.

Remove any WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, or ORDER BY clause from your
statement or remove TABLE(:coll_host_var) from the FROM clause of your
statement.


-9613	Select list cannot have expression when selecting from a collection.

Only '*' or column names are allowed in the select list for derived
tables that use collections. Check your SELECT list.


-9614	Derived column list is not allowed for this statement.

UPDATE statements do not require derived-column lists. Columns are
listed in parentheses following a table name. Also, in any SQL
statement, a derived-column list can be associated only with
collection-derived tables and not others.

Remove the derived-column list from the UPDATE statement.


-9615	AT keyword is not allowed when inserting in a base table.

Use the AT keyword only when you are inserting into a LIST.


-9616	Position value should be specified through a constant or a
variable.

The position argument for an AT keyword of a list must be a simple integer
literal or host variable.

Simplify the expression to one of these.


-9617	Source for the SET clause should be a simple expression.

Collection derived tables can only be updated using constants, host
variables, or table columns.


-9618	Aliasing is not allowed for a collection of ROW types.

For collection-derived tables, you need not provide a column name
alias. Remove the column name alias.


-9620	Cannot select the collection variable (collection_variable_name).

This error occurs within SPL when you attempt to place an SPL collection
variable in the select list. You must remove the collection variable
from the select list.


-9621	The number of derived columns do not match the actual number of columns.

For collection-derived tables, you must provide number of derived columns 
matching with columns in select list. 
For example, the following SELECT statement would cause error -9621:

SELECT * FROM TABLE(MULTISET(SELECT colno, colname FROM syscolumns WHERE 
		tabid > 99)) AS vtab(vc1) 


-9623	Internal length must be greater than zero and smaller than 32,768.

When you use the CREATE OPAQUE TYPE statement to define a fixed-length
opaque type, the value that you specify for the internal length
modifier must be greater than 0 bytes and smaller than 32,768 bytes.

Use a valid value to define the type.


-9624	Maximum length must be greater than zero and smaller than 32,768.

When you use the CREATE OPAQUE TYPE statement to define a variable-
length opaque type, the value that you specify for the maximum length
modifier must be greater than 0 bytes and smaller than 32,768 bytes.
Redefine the type with a valid value.


-9625	Alignment must be set to 1, 2, 4 or 8.

When you use the CREATE OPAQUE TYPE statement to define an opaque type,
the value that you specify for the alignment modifier must be 1, 2, 4,
or 8. Redefine the type with a valid value.


-9626	Maximum length should be set for variable-sized opaque types only.

When you use the CREATE OPAQUE TYPE statement to define a fixed-length
opaque type, you should not specify the maximum length modifier.


-9627	Passedbyvalue can only be set if length is 1, 2, or 4.

When you use the CREATE OPAQUE TYPE statement to define a fixed-length
opaque type that is passed by value, its internal length must be 1, 2,
or 4.


-9628	Type (type_name) not found.

The specified type_name could not be found. The datatype name you use 
should either be a built-in datatype of GBase Server or 
an extended datatype explicitly created by the user/application. 
If you encounter this error on a Read-only Secondary of an HDR pair, 
check to see if the specified type_name was ever created on the Primary.


Example of extended datatypes: distinct type, row type, collection type, 
and opaque type. Before you can use an extended type, you must 
create it with the CREATE <datatype> TYPE statement.
example: CREATE DISTINCT TYPE di AS INT;
	 CREATE ROW TYPE rt (a INT, b CHAR(10));


-9629	Not owner of type.

USAGE permission is required for the use of opaque types. Use the GRANT
USAGE ON TYPE statement to grant permission to use a type.


-9630	Cannot drop type (type_name): still in use.

An opaque type cannot be dropped while it is in use. Be sure that no
casts, functions, or distinct type definitions are based on the type.


-9631	Opaque type (type_name) already exists in database.

Opaque types must be unique within the schema (ANSI mode) or database.
Be sure that the type does not already exist.


-9632	Value does not match the type of column (column_name).

If the value does not match the data type of the column, but can 
be converted into the data type of the column, then you might need 
to use an implicit or explicit cast.  

If you want the conversion to be automatic, then create an 
implicit cast by using the CREATE IMPLICIT CAST statement to define 
a cast between the source and destination types.  See the description
of the CREATE CAST statement in the GBase Guide to SQL: Syntax.  

In some cases, you might need to use explicit casting. A common cause
of error -9632 is failure to explicitly cast a row type. For example,
the following INSERT statement would cause error -9632:

   CREATE ROW TYPE rt1 (i INT, f FLOAT);
   CREATE TABLE table1 (rt1_col rt1);
   INSERT INTO table1 (rt1_col) VALUES (ROW(1, 2.0));

The correct INSERT statement, with the explicit cast, follows:

   INSERT INTO table1 (rt1_col) VALUES (ROW(1, 2.0)::rt1);


-9633	ALTER TABLE cannot modify column (column_name) type.  Need a cast from
the current type to the new type.

Conversions of column types require a cast. Use the CREATE CAST
statement to define a cast from the source to destination type.


-9634	No cast from <type-name>.

The specified cast does not exist or the cast function does not exist. Use
the CREATE CAST statement to define the cast or to create the cast function.


-9635	An attempt has failed to convert an opaque type into another type
without a cast function.

The specified cast does not exist or the cast function does not exist. Use
the CREATE CAST statement to define the cast or to create the cast function.

The BOOLEAN, BLOB, CLOB, and LVARCHAR data types are implemented by the
database server as built-in opaque data types.


-9636	Opaque type exceeded its maximum length.

Opaque types are defined with a maximum length that cannot be
exceeded. Verify that user-defined routines that return the type do
not attempt to exceed the size limit.


-9637	Cast function (function_name) does not exist.

The function associated with a cast must exist when the cast is
executed. Use the CREATE FUNCTION statement to create the function.


-9638	Grant/Revoke under on opaque types disallowed.

The UNDER clause in the GRANT/REVOKE statements applies to row types
only. It cannot be used with opaque types.


-9639	Grant/Revoke under on distinct of non-row types disallowed.

The UNDER clause in the GRANT/REVOKE statements applies to row types
(and distinct of row-types) only. You cannot use the UNDER clause with
non-row types or distinct of non-row types.


-9640	Cannot drop type (type_name): distinct type defined over the type.

Before you can drop a type, you must first drop all distinct types
based on the type.


-9641	Drop type can only drop opaque type or distinct type.

The DROP TYPE statement applies to opaque and distinct types only. Use
DROP ROW TYPE statement to drop row types.


-9642	A quoted string exceeds 32,768 bytes.

The system imposes a limit of 32,768 bytes on quoted strings. You
cannot exceed this limit.


-9643	Type (type_name) is not hashable.

Hashing is used in GROUPBY queries and as a mechanism to eliminate
duplicate values in DISTINCT and UNION, INTERSECT, or MINUS clauses. You cannot 
use types declared as non-hashable in these statements.


-9645	Cannot execute cast from user-defined type to character format.

When you use the debugging feature of SPL to print the content of a
user-defined, data-type variable, this error occurs if the database
server cannot find or execute the cast function to convert from the
given user-defined data type to character or long format.


-9646	Result of a Boolean expression is not of Boolean type.

When a conditional expression, such as a WHERE clause or an IF clause,
is evaluated in this statement, the result is not a Boolean value. All
conditional expressions must evaluate to a Boolean value, so check that
all conditional expressions evaluate correctly. If the expression does
not, use appropriate casts to make it evaluate properly.

-9647	Cannot drop extended type <extended_type_name>: still in use.

The extended type that you are attempting to drop is being referenced by
another type or table. Before you drop the extended type, first drop any 
type or table that refers to the extended type.

-9648	Invalid value specified for a Boolean type

't','T' or 'f','F' or NULL are the only valid values for boolean type.

-9649	Cannot transport a user-defined type to client versions earlier than version 9.

This operation is not supported in pre-version 9.x client. 


-9650	Right hand side of IN expression must be a COLLECTION type.

The column that is specified for the IN clause must be a COLLECTION
type. For other data types you must specify values in a parenthesized list. 
For example:

	SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUSTOMER_NUM IN (101);
 
-9651	The statement failed because binary large objects are not allowed in 
the Union, Intersect, or Minus queries.
 
You selected a TEXT or BYTE column in a UNION, INTERSECT, or MINUS query. The 
projection clause of each query cannot include any TEXT or BYTE columns. These 
columns are not allowed in a UNION, INTERSECT, or MINUS clause because TEXT 
and BYTE columns cannot be tested for equality. A UNION ALL clause, however, 
can include TEXT and BYTE columns (in a standalone SELECT statement or in a 
UNION view).

-9653	UNDER  privilege required to create subtype/subtable.

The user is not the owner of the type or table under which the statement
attempted to create a subtype or subtable, and the user has not been
granted the UNDER privilege on that type or table.

To create a named row type under an existing named row type or to create
a table under an existing table, you must be the owner of the supertype
or supertable or you must have been granted the UNDER privilege on that
supertype or supertable. For example, the following sequence of statements
allows a user named user2 to create a named row type and table under the
row type and table that user1 created.

   -- As user named user1
   CREATE ROW TYPE super_rt (int_col INT);
   GRANT USAGE ON TYPE super_rt TO user2;
   GRANT UNDER ON TYPE super_rt TO user2;

   CREATE TABLE super_table OF TYPE super_rt;
   GRANT UNDER ON super_table TO user2;

   -- As user named user2
   CREATE ROW TYPE sub_rt (float_col FLOAT) UNDER user1.super_rt;
   CREATE TABLE sub_table OF TYPE sub_rt UNDER user1.super_table;


-9654	The element types of the collection are not unique; explicit 
casting is required.

The element types of the complex type (row, set, multiset, or list) are
not unique and cannot be converted from one complex type to another
complex type by implicit casting. Use the explicit casting notation to 
explicitly cast the source complex type to the desired target complex type.


-9656	Cannot create a distinct type of type (serial or serial8 or bigserial).

The statement specified creation of a distinct data type as SERIAL or SERIAL8
or BIGSERIAL.  A SERIAL or SERIAL8 or BIGSERIAL data type cannot be a 
distinct type.

Remove DISTINCT from the statement or specify a different data type.

-9657	Cannot determine the data type of a collection in the given expression.

The data type of a collection used in the provided expression cannot be
determined until run time. Casting the collection to a specific data
type usually solves this problem.


-9700	Routine (routine_name) ambiguous - more than one routine
resolves to given signature.

This problem happens when an argument (or its source type or parent
type) has implicit casts to the parameters of two or more routines.

For example, assume two routines exist called routine_name(paramtype1)
and routine_name(paramtype2), and routine_name is invoked with
routine_name(argtype). Also, implicit casts exist from argtype to
paramtype1 and argtype to paramtype2. In this case, this error is
raised.

The error is also raised, if instead of argtype, argtype_dad which is
in the source type hierarchy of argtype (if argtype is a distinct type)
or in the super type hierarchy of argtype (if argtype is a row type)
has casts to paramtype1 and paramtype2.

You will need to redefine the implicit casting scheme, such that only
one casts exists from argtype to either paramtype1 or paramtype2 or
remove one of the routines.


-9701	An EXTERNAL PROCEDURE cannot have RETURN clause.

Do not specify the returns/returning clause to a PROCEDURE that is an
external procedure. You can specify this clause for a SPL procedure,
but specifying a RETURN clause to a procedure is highly discouraged.


-9702	When a FUNCTION is created, the RETURN clause must be specified.

All functions must return a value. Specify a return clause or use a
CREATE PROCEDURE statement.


-9703	Modifiers VARIANT and NOT VARIANT cannot be used in the same routine.

Either VARIANT or NOT VARIANT can be specified either as a modifier or
as a clause after the LANGUAGE clause. If both are specified, they must
both be specified as VARIANT or as NOT VARIANT. Either make them
consistent or remove one of the references as a modifier or as a clause
after the LANGUAGE clause.


-9704	For SPL routine, parameter must be named.

The name of the parameter in a CREATE FUNCTION or CREATE PROCEDURE
statement is optional only for external routines. Specify the parameter
name.


-9705	The modifier (modifier-name) is not valid for SPL routines.

This message displays a modifier that you cannot specify for an SPL
routine. The following modifiers are invalid for SPL routines: CLASS, CLIENT, HANDLESNULLS, INTERNAL, ITERATOR, PARALLELIZABLE, PERCALL_COST, SELFUNC, and STACK. Other modifiers might also be invalid.


-9706	END PROCEDURE/FUNCTION does not match with CREATE PROCEDURE/FUNCTION.

If you are using a CREATE PROCEDURE statement, the end clause must
contain END PROCEDURE. If you are using a CREATE FUNCTION statement,
the end clause must contain END FUNCTION. Do not mix and match
PROCEDURE and FUNCTION keywords.


-9707	Modifiers COMMUTATOR and NEGATOR are not allowed in procedure.

Because procedures do not return values, these modifiers are not
allowed in a CREATE PROCEDURE statement. Use a CREATE FUNCTION
statement or do not specify these modifiers.


-9708	SELFUNC modifier can only be used in EXTERNAL FUNCTION.

Do not specify SELFUNC modifier to a SPL routine or an external
procedure.


-9709	More than one distinct type of the parameter type have cast to argument
type.

This situation occurs if more than one distinct type of the source type
of the parameter has casts from the argument type. For example, assume
the routine routine_name(paramtype) exists. Both paramdist1 and
paramdist2 are distinct types of paramdist1. The routine is invoked as
routine_name(argtype). Casts also exist from argtype to paramdist1 and
argtype to paramdist2. Because distinct types inherit all the routines
defined on the source types, paramdist2 and paramdist1 inherit the
routine routine_name. Thus the routine resolution cannot resolve the
routine, and this error results.


-9710	Overloading of built-in functions is not allowed.

Built-in functions such as dbinfo and trim should not be overloaded.
Change the name of the routine that you are creating so that it does
not conflict with the names already used in the database server.


-9711	Late bound functions cannot have different number of return values

Due to late binding, the function that is executed could change in the
middle of query execution. This error is called if the number of values
returned by the new function is not the same as the previous function.
All functions with the same name defined over a type hierarchy should
have the same number of return values.


-9712	Late bound functions cannot have different return types.

Due to late binding, the function that is executed could change in the
middle of query execution. This error results if the type of values
returned by the new function is not the same as the previous function.
All functions with the same name defined over a type hierarchy should
have the same type of return values.


-9713	Identifier too long - maximum allowed length for this identifier is 128.

The specific name specified in the CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE FUNCTION
statement is longer than 128 bytes. Shorten the name.


-9714	OUT parameter can only be the last parameter of a routine.

When an OUT parameter is specified in the CREATE FUNCTION statement, it
must be the last parameter and the only parameter with the OUT option.


-9715	A procedure cannot have any OUT parameters.

A CREATE PROCEDURE function cannot have OUT parameters. Only a CREATE
FUNCTION statement can have OUT parameters in the parameter. The
parameter specified as OUT should be the only and last parameter.


-9716	This routine routine_name has the same specific name as another routine.

A specific name is unique within a name space. In a non-ANSI database,
it is unique within a database. In an ANSI database, it is unique
within the user's schema. Change the name to a unique name.


-9717	Owner name specified in the routine name and specific name must be the
same.

If the specific name is qualified with the owner name, the owner name
specified should be the same as the owner name used in qualifying the
routine being created. If the routine name is not qualified, it should
be the same as the current user.


-9718	Owner name specified in the specific name must be the current user.

If the specific name is qualified with the owner name, the owner name
specified should be the same as the owner name used in qualifying the
routine being created. If the routine name is not qualified, it should
be the same as the current user.


-9719	A routine and an aggregate cannot share the same name.

An attempt to create a routine (UDR) with the same name as an aggregate
is illegal. Also, creating an aggregate with the same name as a routine
is also invalid. A routine name may not also match a built-in aggregate
name, like sum(), count(), or max().

Change the aggregate or the routine name that is causing the failure.


-9720	Module name or language name specified is not valid.

The module name or language name that you specified in the
ifx_replace_module() or ifx_unload_module() function call is not 
valid. The only valid language name for these functions is C. 

Check the module names for correctness. Check if module path is
included in the values for the DB_LIBRARY_PATH configuration parameter.
Replace the module name or language name, or update the value of 
DB_LIBRARY_PATH, and execute the function again.


-9721	Module name could not be unloaded while in use.

You can use the ifx_unload_module() function only to unload an 
unused shared-object file; that is, when no executing SQL statements 
(in any database) are using any user-defined routines in the specified 
shared-object file.

Wait until all active SQL statements complete before trying to unload
the shared-object file.


-9722	Specify a non-zero SQL error number in the RAISE EXCEPTION statement.

You must provide a non-zero value for the SQL error number parameter in the
RAISE EXCEPTION statement. To display your customized error string,
specify -746 as the value of the SQL error.


-9740	Execution of remote routine (routine_name) with non-built-in types is
not allowed.

When you invoke a remote routine you cannot pass complex data types or 
unsupported user-defined opaque types as routine arguments or return types. 
Cast the unsupported data types to supported data types or create the 
routine in the local database.


-9741	Internal error - attempt to pass arguments in C style while requiring
argument casts.

An internal programming error occurred. If this error recurs,
note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-9743	Internal error - unable to determine all routines in statement.

A SQL statement that passed host variables into routines still had
unknown routine argument types after host variable binding. Rerun the
query without passing host variables to any routine or rerun the query
and pass the correct number of host variables.


-9744	BUILTIN routine routine_name definition does not match internal
operator.

This entry from SYSPROCEDURES with language BUILTIN does not match the
internal format of the operator that is being overloaded. If this error
recurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-9748	Cannot convert argument types when passing arguments by name, routine
routine_name.

At least one argument requires a cast before it can be passed into the
routine. Casts are not supported when passing arguments by name. Use
explicit casts from the argument to the parameter type.


-9750	Routine routine_name determined during PREPARE and BIND/EXECUTE return
different types.

If host variables are used in the statement that is being prepared, in
the absence of argument types information, the server tries to resolve
to a routine that is most likely the routine to which the user intended
to resolve. However, during BIND/EXECUTE time, in the presence of
argument type information, the routine specified in the statement might
resolve to a different routine. In that case, if the return types of
the routine that the server originally selected are different than the
one later resolved, this error is raised.

-9751	Cannot prepare the statement because the return type of the routine 
routine_name is not known.

The database server could not prepare the statement because a host variable 
was specified without a data type in a routine acting on a collection-derived 
table.  
You must cast the host variable to a data type that the routine takes as an 
argument. 

For example, the following statement fails to prepare because the argument type 
of the ST_IsValid routine is not specified: 
SELECT * FROM table(function ST_IsValid(?));

The following statement prepares successfully because the host variable 
is cast to a valid data type for the ST_IsValid routine: 
SELECT * FROM table(function ST_IsValid(?::st_multipolygon));

-9752	Argument must be a Statement Local Variable or SPL variable or argument for an OUT or INOUT parameter.

UDRs with OUT/INOUT parameters cannot be used in the WHERE clause of a 
SELECT statement unless the OUT/INOUT parameters are defined as Statement 
Local Variables (SLV). For example

	SELECT *
	FROM mytable
        WHERE foo (arg1, arg2, inout1, inout2, ...., inoutn) ;
 
is not a valid syntax assuming that foo is a UDR which has OUT/INOUT
parameters denoted by inout1...inoutn above. To use UDR foo in the WHERE
clause the above example must be modified to

             SELECT myslv1 , ..., myslvN, *
             FROM   mytable
             WHERE  foo (arg1, arg2, myslv1 # svlDataType1, 
                              ..., myslvN # svlDataTypeN);

myslv1, ..., myslvN are the SLVs defined for the OUT/INOUT parameters 
with return datatype svlDataType1, ..., svlDataTypeN respectively. 
Please note that it is optional to use the SLVs in the projection 
list for the SELECT statement.


You can invoke an SPL routine or a C UDR with OUT or INOUT parameters 
within a routine written in SPL. The parameter you pass into the OUT or 
INOUT parameter must be either an SPL variable or a parameter from another 
SPL routine, and the parameter cannot be passed as any form of expression.

Example:
create procedure p1(inout in1 integer);
  define a int;
  let a = in1;
  let in1 = a + 1;
end procedure;

create function f1(in1 integer) returning integer;
  call p1(in1);
  return in1;
end function;


-9753	Unable to find User Defined Routine with the given id.

The user defined routine with the specified ID cannot be found.

CAUSE
The user defined routine ID is incorrect or has been changed.

ACTION
Correct the ID in the prepared statement and then reprepare and execute the
statement.

-9754	No usage privilege.

The user does not have usage privilege on create functions or the user does
not have grant/revoke usage privilege on a language. This error is returned
when the user does not have the privilege to create a user-defined routine.

Ask user gbasedbt or a user with GRANT option privilege on the language to
grant usage permission to you.


-9757	Remote iterator function is not supported in this context.

Remote iterator function used in the context of a table reference is not
currently supported. Only local server iterator functions can be used.

For example, this is not supported:
select * from table (function remote_db@remote_server:tv1());


-9780	Statement-local variable cannot be an argument to a function called
from outside the WHERE clause.

A user-defined routine (UDR) invocation that accepts a Statement
Local Variable as an argument can be performed only in a WHERE clause
of a Data Manipulation Language statement. This error results if this
rule is violated. Move the UDR invocation inside a WHERE clause.


-9781	SLV cannot be an argument to a function invoked explicitly by EXECUTE
or CALL.

A routine that has an OUT parameter can only be invoked as part of a
data-management language query (only in the WHERE clause). Do not
invoke such a routine with a CALL or EXECUTE statement.


-9782	Statement Local Variable has already been defined.

The same statement-local variable (SLV) is used for different OUT and INOUT 
parameters in a query. Ensure that the SLV is unique within a query.


-9784	SLV (my_slv) has no producer-UDR; or is outside the scope of the
producer-UDR.

A statement-local variable (SLV) is out of scope. For example, given a UNION,
INTERSECT, or MINUS of two SELECT statements, one SELECT statement declares 
an SLV and the other SELECT statement references the SLV.


-9785	SLV (my_slv) cannot be accessed before it is produced by a UDR

You cannot access the SLV until it is generated in the UDR. The following statement will produce the error:

SELECT slv_var FROM my_table WHERE foo_slv(slv_var # int) 
	OR my_table.column IN (100,200,300);

If the IN clause of the OR condition in the WHERE clause is evaluated before the UDR foo_slv is called,
then slv_var is not initialized. 

-9786	Only iterative UDR allowed in this context.

The function used in the FROM clause of a select statement should be an iterative UDR.
The iterative UDRs written in SPL should have 'return with resume' clause. 

For example,
create procedure ret_x1() returning dint;
define r1 dint;
    foreach select a into r1 from x1
        return r1 with resume;
    end foreach;
end procedure;


The iterative UDRs written in C or Java should be create with 'with (iterator)' modifier
in the CREATE FUNCTION statement and should handle the different states of iteration.

create function fibgen(arg integer) returning integer
with ( iterator)
external name "$userfuncdir/fib.udr(fibGen)"
language c;


-9790	Language Manager initialization failed.

This error can occur in the following scenarios:

1.  The database server could not load internal C language or
    initialize data areas during server initialization.

    The following error message appears in the log:

    Language Manager initialization failed.

2.  An internal Language Manager error occurs during UDR loading 
    or execution, causing a failure such as memory allocation 
    or locking.

    The following error messages appears in the log:

    ERROR: Loading Routine routine_name procid = process_ID_number file:
    sqlmload.c

    ERROR: Unloading Routine routine_name procid = process_ID_number file:
    sqlmunld.c

    ERROR: Routine execution problem -- procname= procedure_name procid =
    process_ID_number file: sqlmexec.c


-9791	User-defined routine execution failed.

This error occurs under the following circumstances:

1.  A language problem occurred or an internal server error
    exists. In this case, the following log message is entered 
    in the log:

    ERROR: Routine execution failed -- procname = routine_name procid =
    process_ID_number

2.  The executing routine has caused one of the following
    exceptions:

       mem -- memory fault

       ill -- illegal instruction

       fpt -- floating point or divide by zero

       sys -- system call problem

       "xxx" -- SAPI layer exception explanation

    The following error message appears in the log:

    ERROR: Routine execution trap -- procname = procedure_name procid =
    process_ID_number reason: error_string


-9792	User-defined-routine language initialization failed.

A module failed to load, or an internal language error occurred. The
following error message appears in the log:

ERROR: Initializing Language language_name Module module_name


-9793	User Defined Routine (<routine-name>) module load failed.

The following error message appears in the log:

    ERROR: Loading Module <module-name>

A bad external name, missing file, or wrong permissions might cause this
error. Log message <log-message-number> contains the UNIX error number
encountered and the actual module name being used. For the C language on
UNIX, the following log message might appear:

    <error-number>: C Language Module <module-name> can't load <error-string>

In the log message, <error-number> is the current UNIX error number,
<module-name> is the module name from the catalog, and <error-string> is the
dlerror() explanation.


-9794	User-defined-routine load failed.

The following error message appears in the log:

Loading Routine routine_name procid = process_ID_number

The routine routine_name is not found in the module, possibly because
of a bad external name or the wrong module. The log message
log_message_number is probably -1, and error_message_string is the
database routine name as opposed to the symbol that was not found.


-9795	User-defined-routine unload failed.

The following error message appears in the log:

ERROR: Unloading Routine error_name procid = process_ID_number


-9796	User-defined routine module unload failed.

An internal system error occurred from a call to dlclose for Solaris C
modules. The following error message appears in the log:

ERROR: Unloading Module error_string


-9797	User-defined routine language shutdown failed.

The language did not shut down correctly. Probably an internal system
error occurred. The following error message appears in the log:

ERROR: error_string Language Shutdown


-9798	User-defined routine language lookup failed.

Language information is not defined in the system. Either the routine
definition is wrong, or something happened to the data dictionary. The
following error message appears in the log:

ERROR: Language error_string -- lookup failed


-9799	User-defined routine vitual-processor context-switch failed.

The database server could not switch to or back from the needed VP
during load, unload, or execution. The VP class could be wrong in the
routine definition, or the VPCLASS parameter could be missing from the
onconfig file. The following error messages appear in the log:

   ERROR: Routine execution VP switch failed -- new VP error_string

   ERROR: Routine execution VP switch failed -- old VP id = VP_ID

Make sure the VP class is correct in the routine definition. Also,
check the ONCONFIG file to make sure that it includes a VPCLASS
parameter for this type of virtual processor and that the setting
of the JVPCLASSPATH parameter is correct.


-9800	Table table_name is typed.

You cannot add a type to a table that is already typed. Drop the table
type and try adding the type again.


-9801	Cannot alter table table_name to add type.  Incompatible.

The column names and the column types of the table do not match the
field names and the field types of the type. Change them to
statements.


-9802	Cannot alter typed table <table_name>.

The only valid ALTER TABLE statement for a typed table is one that drops
the table type.

If you need to use any other ALTER TABLE statement on the table, first
drop the table type.


-9803	Cannot create typed view <view-name>. Incompatible.

Either you attempted to use a BYTE or TEXT field in a typed view or the
column names and the column types of the view do not match the field names
and the field types of the type.

Remove any BYTE or TEXT fields or change the field types to match those of
the underlying columns.


-9804	Cannot generate ROWIDS on typed table <table_name>.

Cannot have a ROWIDS column in a typed table. Either untype the table
with ALTER TABLE or do not create a ROWID column.


-9805	SERIAL/SERIAL8/BIGSERIAL data types allowed only as table column types.

You cannot have SERIAL/SERIAL8/BIGSERIAL data types in CREATE ROW statements.
They are allowed only as table-column types.


-9806	Cannot have duplicate/null field names in unnamed row types.

The CREATE ROW TYPE statement has duplicate field names or is missing one or
more field names.

Specify a unique name for each field in the CREATE ROW TYPE statement.


-9807	Temporary table <temptable_name> cannot be created with a type.

You cannot create temporary tables with types; typed tables are only
for permanent tables. Instead, try using the following example to
create a temporary table:

Instead of:
   CREATE ROW TYPE rowtypename (columnname int);
   CREATE TEMP TABLE tablename OF TYPE rowtypename;
use:
   CREATE TEMP TABLE tablename (columnname int);


-9808	The subtable type must be a subtype of the supertable type.

When creating a table hierarchy of supertable and subtable, the subtype for 
that subtable must also be a subtype of the supertable type (supertype). There
must be a type hierarchy defined before the corresponding table hierarchy can 
be defined.


-9809	Cannot specify blobspace names on TEXT or BYTE field types.

When specifying TEXT or BYTE fields in a complex type, do not specify the name
of the blobspace for that data type. The server uses the default partition 
blobspace for that TEXT or BYTE data type.


-9810	Smart-large-object error.

An error occurred during the processing of a smart large object.

For more information, check the accompanying, detailed smart-large-object
error code.


-9811	Invalid smart-large-object fd (<lo_fd>).

An attempt was made to access a smart large object using an
invalid LO file descriptor. Check that the LO file descriptor you
supplied is correct and that the smart large object is still open.


-9812	Cannot do implicit begin work.

Internal error. This error can be caused by many different situations, 
If the error reoccurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support. 
 
GBase Server implicitly begins transactions for executing SQL 
statements. Sometimes, GBase Server implicitly uses a separate 
transaction while recompiling statements within a procedure written in the 
Stored Procedure Language to write the new plan to the catalog. In that case, 
a failure to begin work results in the failure to execute the procedure.  


-9813	Cannot do implicit commit work.

Internal error. This error can be caused by many different situations, 
If the error reoccurs, note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support. 
 
GBase Server implicitly commits transactions for executing SQL 
statements. Sometimes, GBase Server implicitly uses a separate 
transaction while recompiling statements within a procedure written in the 
Stored Procedure Language to write the new plan to the catalog. In that case, 
a failure to commit work results in the failure to execute the procedure.  


-9814	Invalid default sbspace name (sbspace_name)).

The database server is trying to create a smart large object in the
default sbspace, but the sbspace does not exist. Check that the
SBSPACENAME parameter in the ONCONFIG file is the name of an existing
sbspace. If necessary, the database server administrator can create an
sbspace using the onspaces command.


-9815	Invalid filename specification (file_spec).

You are calling a function that creates an operating-system
file, but the filename specification supplied is not valid.


-9816	Btree index not allowed on blob/clob columns.

You have attempted to use a B-tree index on a column that contains a
smart large object. You must change your program to eliminate the index.


-9818	Error detected in sql smart-large-object hash table.

Internal error. Contact GBase Technical Support.


-9819	Column (column_name) incorrect type for storage in sbspace.

You have attempted to store a column in an sbspace that is not an
appropriate type. Only CLOB and BLOB columns can be stored in sbspaces.
Columns of types TEXT and BYTE may not be stored in an sbspace.


-9820	SQL SBLOB error: no such sbspace.

The most likely problem is that an operation specifies an sbspace
by name (for example, in the PUT clause of a CREATE TABLE statement),
but that sbspace has not been created.

You can run the onstat utility with the -d option to see the names
of sbspaces created. Ask the database server administrator
about creating a new sbspace.


-9823	Inconsistent use of procedure named return parameters.

A procedure has duplicate return parameter names or only a partial list of return parameter names.

Example of error:

RETURNING INT AS customer, INT AS customer; -- error
RETURNING INT AS customer, INT; -- error


-9824	Cannot perform more than one online create/drop index operation on 
table.


-9825	Online create/drop index not allowed on VII indexes.


-9826	Cannot perform online create/drop index operation along with storage optimization operation.

-9827	The sbspace specified by the SYSSBSPACENAME configuration parameter does not exist (syssbspace_name).

The database server failed to create a smart large object in the
sbspace that is specified by the SYSSBSPACENAME configuration parameter
because the sbspace does not exist. Check that the value of the
SYSSBSPACENAME configuration parameter in the onconfig file is the
name of an existing sbspace. If necessary, the database server
administrator can create an sbspace using the onspaces command and
update the value of the SYSSBSPACENAME configuration parameter
in the onconfig file.

The UPDATE STATISTICS operation might require an existing sbspace,
which is specified by the SYSSBSPACENAME configuration parameter.

-9831	Could not find opclass id opclass_ID while resolving compare routine
for index.

The operator class for one or more key parts of the index no longer
exists in the database. The index is no longer valid and must be
dropped.


-9832	Could not find routine routine_name while resolving compare routine.

Either the comparison routine for one or more key parts of the index no
longer exists in the database, or the comparison routine required to
perform a sort cannot be found. You need to re-create the compare
routine. If an index is involved, the index needs to be dropped.


-9833	Could not find extended type type_ID for index.

The type of one or more key parts of the index no longer exists in the
database. The index is no longer valid and must be dropped.


-9835	Could not find routine ID routine_ID for functional key.

The routine identified by the routine ID for one or more functional key
parts no longer exists in the database. The index is no longer valid
and must be dropped.


-9836	Could not initialize sequence for routine <routine-name>.

A user-defined routine is missing a statcollect() or compare() function.

Add the missing function to the user-defined routine.


-9838	Cannot create operator class for a primary access method.

You cannot create an operator class for a primary access method. For a
list of available secondary access methods, you can perform the
following query.

SELECT * FROM GBASEDBT.SYSAMS WHERE AM_TYPE = 'S';


-9839	Cannot mix generic and specific operators in an operator class.

If you specify the full function signature for one of the strategy
functions in the operator class, you need to specify the function
signatures for all of the strategy functions.


-9840	Invalid number of strategies or support function for btree.

You must specify no more than five operators (operators implementing
lessthan, lessthanorequal, equal, greaterthanorequal, and greaterthan)
and exactly one support function (the comparison function) in CREATE
OPCLASS for the btree access method.


-9841	Operator class for key part not specified or invalid.

The operator class specified in one or more of the key parts is 
invalid. Probable causes for this error include:

*   You might be using an operator class for a different access method
    than the one with which you are creating the index.

*   If the access method that you use does not have a default
    operator class associated with it, you must explicitly specify the
    operator class for each key part.

*   Data type of the key column and that of the operator class do not 
    match, where strategy function signatures are specified for the operator 
    class.


-9842	Specification of ASC/DESC only applicable to btree.

You cannot specify ASC or DESC in the key part if you are using an
access method other than btree.


-9843	Invalid number of arguments for functional key.

A functional key part can only take between 1 and 16 arguments.


-9844	Invalid function function_name used in a functional key.

The function used in a CREATE INDEX statement cannot be used as a
functional key part. Make sure that the function you use is not a
variant function.


-9845	Access method access_method_name does not exist in database.

The access method used in a CREATE INDEX or CREATE OPCLASS statement
does not exist. Before you can use an access method, you must create it
with a CREATE ACCESS_METHOD statement. For a list of available access
methods, see gbasedbt.sysams.


-9846	Operator class operator_class_name does not exist in database.

The operator class used in a CREATE INDEX statement does not exist.
Before you can use an operator class, you must create it with a CREATE
OPCLASS statement. See gbasedbt.sysopclasses for a list of available
operator classes.


-9848	Functional key part cannot use a variant function function_name.

The function used in a CREATE INDEX statement for a functional key part
must be a nonvariant function (that is, it must be created with the NOT
VARIANT modifier in the CREATE FUNCTION statement).


-9849	Compare routine routine_name cannot be in SPL

The compare routine used for a generic B-tree cannot be written in SPL.
You should rewrite the compare routine in C.


-9851	Access method access_method_name already exists in database.

The access method that you are creating with a CREATE ACCESS_METHOD
statement already exists. You must use a new name.


-9852	Improper purpose purpose_name used for access method.

A purpose used with the CREATE ACCESS_METHOD or ALTER ACCESS_METHOD
statement is improper. It might be spelled incorrectly. Otherwise, it
is used incorrectly in combination with the other purposes, or it is a
purpose that is not appropriate for the type of access method. For
example, an access method cannot be created with AM_DELETE if AM_ROWIDS
is not used, and AM_GETBYID cannot be used for a secondary access
method. Correct the spelling of the purpose or change one or more of
the purposes until the combination of purposes is valid.


-9853	Duplicate purpose purpose_name used for access method.

A purpose used with the CREATE ACCESS_METHOD or ALTER ACCESS_METHOD
statement has been used more than once. Change the purposes used until
no duplicates exist.


-9854	Required purpose purpose_name not used for access method.

A required purpose has not been used with the CREATE ACCESS_METHOD
statement, or a required or default purpose has been removed with the
ALTER ACCESS_METHOD statement. For example, AM_SCANCOST has a default
value if not used with the CREATE ACCESS_METHOD statement, but it
cannot be dropped with the ALTER ACCESS_METHOD statement. Change the
purposes used until the required purposes are included or preserved.


-9855	Improper value used for purpose purpose_name for access method.

A purpose has been used with an improper value in a CREATE
ACCESS_METHOD or ALTER ACCESS_METHOD statement. For example, an integer
cannot be used for AM_SPTYPE. Use the proper type of value for the
purpose.


-9856	Index not created because the table's access method doesn't
support rowids.

A CREATE INDEX statement was used on a table whose access method
does not support rowids. Because rows from the table are fetched by the
index by rowid, the index cannot be created.


-9857	Unknown space space_name used for external table/index.

A CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX statement has an IN clause that
references an extspace that does not exist. Use an existing extspace.


-9858	Unsupported option option_name used for an external table/index.

An ALTER TABLE or ALTER INDEX statement has an option that is not
supported by the access method. Remove the option.


-9859	Index not created because its access method does not support
unique keys.

A CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement or CREATE DISTINCT INDEX statement used an
access method that does not support unique keys.

Remove UNIQUE from the CREATE INDEX statement or remove DISTINCT from the
CREATE INDEX statement.


-9860	Improper access method used.

A CREATE TABLE statement used a secondary access method or a CREATE
INDEX statement used a primary access method. Use a primary access
method with CREATE TABLE and a secondary access method with CREATE
INDEX.


-9861	Improper access method parameter information used for an external
table/index.

A CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX statement is using an access method with
parameter information that is improper. For example, the identifier
might be longer than 18 bytes, or the value might be longer than 236
bytes. Correct the parameter information.


-9862	Could not initialize or execute access method routine.

An access method routine failed to execute properly. The RSAM error
code gives more information.


-9863	Opclass opclass_name already exists in database.

The opclass being created with a CREATE OPCLASS statement already
exists. Use a new name.


-9864	Improper strategy definition.

A CREATE OPCLASS statement is using a strategy definition that is
improper. For example, a strategy might take at most three arguments.
Correct the strategy definition.


-9865	Improper support definition.

A CREATE OPCLASS statement is using a support definition that is
improper. For example, a support name can be at most 18 bytes. Correct
the support definition.


-9867	Access method access_method_name not found.

A DROP ACCESS_METHOD or ALTER ACCESS_METHOD statement uses an access
method that does not exist. Use the correct access method.


-9868	Not owner of access method.

The person executing a DROP ACCESS_METHOD or ALTER ACCESS_METHOD
statement is not the owner of the access method or does not have DBA
privileges.


-9869	Cannot drop access method access_method_name: still in use.

A DROP ACCESS_METHOD statement cannot be used if any tables or indexes
are defined using that access method. Drop the tables or indexes first
and then drop the access method.


-9870	Cannot alter access method access_method_name: still in use.

An ALTER ACCESS_METHOD statement cannot be used while anyone is using
the access method. Wait until no one is using the access method and try
again.


-9871	Alter fragment attach/detach for external table not supported.

The ALTER FRAGMENT statement cannot be used for a table or index that
uses an access method. Either create a new table with the desired
properties and copy the data from the old table to the new table or
create a new index with the desired properties.


-9872	Cannot drop operator class operator_class_name: still in use.

The operator class is being used in an existing index and therefore
cannot be dropped. Drop all the indexes that use the operator class
before you drop it.


-9873	Not owner of operator class.

You cannot drop an operator class unless you are the owner or the
database administrator. Contact the database administrator or the owner
of the operator class.

-9874	Cannot rename database if it has a virtual table or index.

You cannot rename a database if the database has any tables created using primary 
access method (also known as virtual table interface) or indices using 
secondary access method (also known as virtual index interface).  R-TREE indices
are implemented using secondary access method and therefore, databases with 
R-TREE indices cannot be renamed.


-9875	Bad internal structure for collection data: unknown flag
value.

The structure of collection or row data might be corrupted.

Report this situation to GBase Technical Support.


-9878	An implied insert column does not accept NULLs.

The statement attempted an implied insert of a null value into a column
that does not accept null values.

Rewrite the INSERT statement to provide a value for any column that
do not accept null values, or redefine the column to accept nulls.


-9880	Storage space <name> is incompatible with the access method.

The operation was unsuccessful because the specified storage space cannot be
used by the access method referenced in the SQL statement.

Change the statement to specify a storage space that is of a type that the
access method supports. To find out whether the access method supports an
extspace (external storage) or sbspace (smart-large-object storage), query
the sysams system catalog table for access method name that you specify in
the CREATE TABLE statement USING clause. Refer to the am_sptype value for
that access method. The following values indicate the type of storage space
that you can use with the access method:

    *   'X' indicates that the access method supports only extspaces
    *   'S' indicates that the access method supports only sbspaces
    *   'A' indicates that the access method supports both extspaces and
        sbspaces

Important: You cannot use a dbspace (Dynamic Server table space storage)
with a user-defined access method. A user-defined access method is one.

For more information about the type of storage spaces that the access method
supports, refer to the access-method user guide.


-9882	Access method AM_SPTYPE purpose value <space-types> is invalid.

The operation failed because the access method specified in the SQL
statement has an invalid value, <space-types>, for its AM_SPTYPE purpose
value.

Because processing for the CREATE PRIMARY ACCESS_METHOD and CREATE SECONDARY
ACCESS_METHOD SQL statements validates the AM_SPTYPE value, this error
should only occur if the row associated with the access method in the sysams
system catalog table was explicitly updated after the access method was
created.

Ask the access-method provider or database administrator to change the
AM_SPTYPE value for the access method with the ALTER ACCESS_METHOD statement.


-9883	Could not determine the type of storage space <name>.

An error occurred while the database server was looking up the type
of the specified storage space (dbspace, sbspace, or extspace).
Usually this problem is related to accessing the sysmaster:sysextnames table.
For more information, refer to the accompanying ISAM error code.


-9884	No default storage space exists for the access method.

None of the storage-space types supported by the access method has a default
storage space.

To correct this error, you can take either of the following actions:

    *   In your SQL statement, explicitly specify the storage spaces for
        the access method to use.

    *   If the access method supports sbspaces, ask your database server
        administrator to create a sbspace with the onspaces utility and
        set the ONCONFIG parameter SBSPACENAME to that sbspace name.

    *   If the access method supports only extspaces, the access method
        software can create a default external storage space, such as a disk
        file.

To find out whether the access method supports an extspace (external
storage) or sbspace (smart-large-object storage), query the sysams system
catalog table for access method name that you specify in the CREATE TABLE
statement USING clause. Refer to the am_sptype value for that access method.
The following values indicate the type of storage space that you can use
with the access method:

    *   'X' indicates that the access method supports only extspaces
    *   'S' indicates that the access method supports only sbspaces
    *   'A' indicates that the access method supports both extspaces and
        sbspaces

For information about how to determine if a storage space is of a type that
an access method supports or how to determine the storage space type that an
access method supports, refer to the access-method user guide.


-9885	Variant user defined routine cannot be used in check constraint
or fragment expression.

You cannot use a variant user-defined routine (UDR) in a check constraint
or fragment expression.

Check your statement to make sure that no variant UDR is used in a check
constraint or fragment expression.


-9885	A check constraint or fragmentation expression cannot contain a 
variant user-defined routine.

A user-defined routine (UDR) in a check constraint or in a fragmentation
expression cannot be variant. That is, the UDR must not return different
results when passed the same arguments. Variant UDRs include routines that
process queries and functions that return random results.

Verify that your statement does not have a variant UDR in a check constraint
or in a fragmentation expression. If you want to alter a UDR that is
currently in a check constraint or in a fragmentation expression from
nonvariant to variant, you must drop its associated check constraints
or its table or index fragments.


-9886	A check constraint or fragmentation expression cannot contain a 
user-defined routine that generates an OUT parameter.

A check constraint or fragmentation expression cannot contain a 
user-defined function that generates an OUT parameter. That is, an OUT 
parameter cannot be passed back to a check constraint or a fragmentation 
expression from a user-defined function.

Verify that your statement does not use a user-defined function that 
generates an OUT parameter in a check constraint or in a fragmentation 
expression.


-9887	A check constraint or fragmentation expression cannot contain a 
cross-database or remote user-defined routine.

The check constraint or fragmentation expression contains a remote or 
cross-database user-defined routine (UDR).

Verify that a UDR in a check constraint or in a fragmentation expression is 
stored within the same database as the check constraint or the 
fragmentation expression.


-9889	Cannot drop the user-defined routine <routine_name> because a 
check constraint or a fragmentation expression currently uses this routine.

To identify the check constraint that uses the routine that you are trying 
to drop, run this query:

   SELECT constraint_id
       FROM syscheckudrdep x, sysprocedures y
       WHERE x.udr_id = y.procid AND
             y.procname = '<routine_name>';

To identify the table or index that has a fragmentation expression that 
uses the routine that you are trying to drop, run this query:

   SELECT tabid, idxname, owner
       FROM sysfragexpudrdep x, sysprocedures y
       WHERE x.udr_id = y.procid AND
             y.procname = '<routine_name>';


-9904	Invalid extended type text.

Could not determine the internal SQL data type. If this error recurs,
note all circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-9905	No extended type information for domain.

Could not find the attribute information for a domain or type. If this
error recurs, note all circumstances and contact
GBase Technical Support.


-9906	Cannot modify column data type to collection type.

You cannot use an ALTER statement to change a column type to a
collection type.


-9907	Not allowed to modify collection type column.

You cannot use an ALTER statement to change a column type from a
collection type to another type.


-9908	Columns of a row type cannot contain fields of type TEXT, BYTE,
SERIAL, SERIAL8 or BIGSERIAL.

You created a table that has a column with a named row of type TEXT,
BYTE, SERIAL, SERIAL8 or BIGSERIAL. The following example should fail:

   create row type rtype (col1 byte);
   create table tab1 (c1 rtype);

Re-create the table with a different type of named row.


-9909	Nested row type not supported

You cannot nest row types.


-9910	Byte, Text, Serial or Serial8 or Bigserial data types in collection type not allowed.

The fields of a row within a collection and the elements of a
collection cannot be of type TEXT, BYTE, SERIAL, or SERIAL8 or BIGSERIAL.


-9911	Defaults on collection type column not allowed.

Default values are not supported in the definition a column of a
collection type. Remove the default value clause.


-9912	Constraints on collection type column not allowed.

Constraint expressions are not supported in the definition of a column
of a collection type. Remove the constraint clause.


-9919	Cast already exists in database.

Casts must be unique with regard to their source and destination types,
regardless of cast class. Use the DROP CAST statement to remove an
existing cast.


-9920	Cannot create a cast between identical types or between built-in types.

No cast is needed between identical types. Casts between built-in types
are handled by internal system casts and cannot be overloaded.


-9922	Cast does not exist in database.

The requested cast does not exist. Use the CREATE CAST statement to
define the cast.


-9923	Cannot create cast between incompatible types.

An attempt was made to define a no-function cast between types with
differing representations. Redefine the cast to use a function or
redefine the types so that they share the same representation.


-9926	The statement failed because row-type or collection columns were 
referenced in ORDER BY, DISTINCT, UNIQUE, INDEX, UNION, INTERSECT, 
or MINUS specifications, or in primary key, foreign key, or unique constraints.

Do not create or alter a table which makes columns of collection or row
types into primary key, foreign key, or unique constraints. Do not create an 
index or UNION, INTERSECT, or MINUS that involves collection or row type 
columns.  However, you can create a union that involves collection or row type 
columns if you use the UNION ALL operator instead of the UNION operator.


-9928	Must supply a cast function for cast between incompatible types.

An attempt was made to define a no-function cast between types with
differing representations.

Redefine the cast to use a function, or redefine the types so that they
share the same representation.


-9930	Byte, Text, Serial or Serial8 or Bigserial datatypes in collection types
not allowed.

You cannot use TEXT, BYTE, SERIAL, or SERIAL8 or BIGSERIAL data types in 
the fields of a row within a collection or the elements of a collection.

-9931	Byte and Text datatypes in row and collection types not
allowed.

You requested the construction of an object that contains a BYTE or
TEXT data type. This is only supported for column types of a table or
CREATE ROW TYPE statement. All other references to a named row type,
unnamed row type, or collection type cannot contain BYTE or TEXT
data types.

-9932	External Directives feature is currently disabled.

You issued a statement that is valid only when the feature
External Directives is enabled. Contact your DBA
if you need to enable it.

-9933	Invalid Directive specification for external directives.

The optimizer directives you specified are invalid.

-9934	Only DBA is authorized to do this operation.

Only users with DBA privileges can perform this operation.

-9935	External Directives already exist for the query.

There are external directives already saved for the specified query. 

Drop the existing external directives first, then the new 
external directives for the query can be saved in the database.

-9943	The collection format is out of date. Recreate the collection data.

Collection data from a 9.10 or earlier 9.x database server was not unloaded
and reloaded for migration to a version 9.11 or 9.12 database server.

If a table column has a collection data type, you must unload the collection
data before migrating to release 9.11 or 9.12, from a 9.10 or earlier
release, and then reload the data after the migration.


-9944	Cannot seek in non-scrollable collection.

You have opened a collection with the flag MI_COLL_NOSCROLL and later
attempted to seek within the collection. Open the collection without this
flag or do not attempt to seek within the collection. 


-9945	Cannot modify a read only collection

You have opened a collection with the flag MI_COLL_READONLY and then
attempted to modify the collection. Do not open the collection with this 
flag or do not modify the collection.


-9946	Cannot open subquery collection twice.

Subquery collections opened with the flags MI_COLL_READONLY and
MI_COLL_NOSCROLL cannot be opened again.


-9950	Field referencing is not possible for non-row type expressions.

Only expressions of the form column.field are only meaningful for objects
of type row.

Remove the .field part of your expression.


-9953	An aggregate function is not allowed in this context.

You cannot use an aggregate function expression as an argument to a 
function or procedure.

An aggregate function is valid only in these contexts:
  in the projection clause of the SELECT statement, 
  in the projection clause or in the WHERE clause of a subquery. 

An aggregate is not valid, however, in the WHERE clause of a subquery 
within a SELECT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement unless each of the following 
conditions is true:
  The aggregate is on a correlated column originating from a parent query.
  The WHERE clause appears in a subquery within a HAVING clause.

You can also include OLAP window aggregate functions in these clauses of 
the SELECT statement:
  The Select list of the Projection clause
  The ORDER BY clause of the SELECT statement 
  Subquery specifications in the Projection clause

To be valid, the OLAP window aggregate function expression must immediately
precede the OVER clause.

To avoid this error, do not call any aggregate function outside the SELECT 
statement and subquery contexts that are listed above as allowing aggregate
expressions.


-9960	Combination of table/index fragmentation not allowed.

If a table is fragmented by round-robin and its subtable specifies its
own fragmentation scheme, you cannot create an index on the supertable
without a fragmentation clause. Either create an index with an explicit
fragmentation clause or let the subtable inherit its fragmentation
scheme from the supertable.


-9965	The maximum number of allowable sbspaces maximum_number has been
exceeded.

The maximum number of 64 sbspaces per table has been exceeded, so your
operation failed. For more information on the number of sbspaces
associated with the table, run the following queries:

SELECT tabid FROM gbasedbt.systables
        WHERE tabname = `<user_table_name>';


SELECT count(*) FROM gbasedbt.syscolattribs
        WHERE tabid = <tabid_from_previous_query>;


-9967	Cannot find data type data_type_name.

The specified data type does not exist in the database. Check
sysxtdtypes to make sure that the data type exists before you use it.


-9969	Corrupted collection type information.

The type information for a collection is not consistent. 

If this error recurs, note all circumstances and contact
GBase Technical Support.


-9970	Cannot determine host variable type during bind.

An ambiguous bind message was received. The database server could not
infer the variable type from the context of the query. The host
variable type must be explicitly defined.


-9971	Cannot determine the return types of a query or return types
are inconsistent.

The database server cannot determine the data type for one or more of
the values that the query is to return.

Check the specification of the data type for each return value,
correct any errors in the specification, and retry the query.


-9973	Row buffer for collection of fixed size elements not of
correct size.

You attempted to insert a new or update an existing collection
element with a value that is not the same size as was declared in the
collection definition. This error occurs only when a collection contains
fixed-length elements.

Check to make certain that the value you are inserting matches the
collection declaration.


-9974	Cannot delete element from a ROW type.

You have attempted to delete a row from a host variable of type ROW.
Because a ROW host variable has only the single row as its contents,
deletion is not allowed. If you want to construct a row with NULL
values, use an UPDATE statement and set each field to a NULL value.
Otherwise, remove the request to execute the SQL DELETE for the row
host variable in your embedded language program.


-9975	Type of a table must be unique within a table hierarchy.

You cannot have siblings of the same type under the same parent. For
example, assume that you create the following row types:

create row type r1 (a int);

create row type r2 under r1;

Now you attempt to create a supertable and two subtables. The third
statement in the following set generates an error:

create table supertab of type r1;

create table subtab1 of type r2 under r1;

create table subtab2 of type r2 under r1;

The third CREATE TABLE statement generates an error because subtab1
and subtab2 would be siblings under supertab. GBase does not support
this table hierarchy in this release. The current version of the database
server restricts the table hierarchy to match the type hierarchy, and
no type can appear more than once within a single hierarchy of tables.


-9976	Manipulation of NULL collection disallowed.

You attempted an action on a NULL collection. Examine your embedded
language program to determine why you are attempting to operate on a
NULL collection.


-9977	Internal Error: hash value out of sync.

This message indicates an error internal to the support of the GBase
server for collection data types. If this error recurs,
note all the circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-9978	Insertion of NULLs into a collection disallowed.

The statement attempted to insert one or more NULL values into a collection.
The elements of a collection must always be non-null. The fields of a row
within a collection can be NULL, but the elements of the collection cannot
be NULL. This error can occur, however, if a collection subquery specifies
an ITEM select and one of the rows contains a NULL value.

The following example is valid for a collection defined with elements of
type row. However, insert into table(:coll_hv2) values (NULL) is not valid
for any collection.

    INSERT INTO TABLE(:coll_hv) VALUES (row(NULL, NULL));

Do not attempt to insert NULL values as elements of a collection.


-9979	Updating of a collection element to NULL is disallowed.

The elements of a collection cannot be NULL. Do not attempt to update
collection elements to NULL values. (See the corrective action for
error message -9978.)


-9980	LIST expected when inserting AT position.

You can use a positional insert statement only with collection of type
LIST. Remove the AT clause from your insert statement.


-9981	Delete disallowed on collection with other cursor references.

You attempted to delete a collection that is being referenced by more
than one cursor. Review your program, determine the relevant cursor to
keep, and remove the other cursor that is acting on the collection.


-9982	Update disallowed on collection with other cursor references.

You attempted to update a collection that is being referenced by more
than one cursor. Review your program, determine the relevant cursor to
keep, and remove the other cursor that is acting on the collection.


-9983	Deleting a nonexisting element.

You positioned your cursor to an element of a collection that no longer
exists and then requested that the element be updated or deleted. This
problem occurs if you use a FETCH statement to position your cursor
past the last record and then attempt an update or delete. An error
results because you are not pointing to a valid record. Make sure your
embedded language program is checking the SQLCODE value returned after
a FETCH to determine that there are no more rows.


-9984	Cannot free a collection with other cursor references.

You attempted to free a collection reference while a cursor is still
opened on the collection. Review your embedded language program to
determine why you are prematurely freeing the collection reference
before you close the cursor.


-9985	Internal Error: invalid change log.

This message indicates an error internal to the support of GBase
database server for collection data types. If this error recurs,
note all the circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-9986	Internal Error: corrupted collection.

This message indicates an error internal to the support of GBase
database server for collection data types. If this error recurs,
note all the circumstances and contact GBase Technical Support.


-9987	Cursor already registered.

You are attempting to open a cursor that is already open. Review your
embedded language program to determine why you are re-opening the
cursor before you close it.


-9988	Cannot flatten a collection with other cursor references.

You attempted to store a collection host variable into a table column,
or row field, but cursors are still open on the collection. You must
close the other cursors before you attempt this operation.


-9989	Incorrect number of fields in the ROW type.

You attempted to store a row with incorrect field types into a
collection. Verify that the row fields match those of the collection.


-9990	Cannot drop named row type <row_type_name>: still in use.

The row type that you are attempting to drop is being referenced by
another type or table, or the row type is used in an SPL routine.

For example:

   CREATE ROW TYPE MyType ...;
   CREATE FUNCTION f(param1 MyType) RETURNS INTEGER;
   ...
   END FUNCTION;
   DROP ROW TYPE MyType;   -- Gets error -9990

Before you drop the row type, first drop any type or table that refers
to the row type and drop any SPL routine that uses it.


-9991	Named row type row_type_name already exists in database.

You are trying to create a named row type whose name is already used.
Use another name or drop the row type to reuse its name.


-9992	Named row type row_type_name not found.

The named row type specified does not exist in the database. Verify its
existence by selecting from sysxtdtypes.


-9993	Not owner of named row type.

You cannot drop the named row type unless you are the owner or have the
DBA privilege. Verify the owner of the named row type by selecting from
sysxtdtypes.


-9994	Cannot use ONLY(TABLE(str)) over collections.

The ONLY syntax is not legal over TABLE expressions over collections.
Use ONLY on supertables; that is, parents in an inheritance chain.


-9995	Table table_name is not typed.

Cannot alter a table to drop its type if the table is not typed. Make
sure you are referring to the correct table.


-9996	Distinct type (<type-name>) already exists in database.

Distinct types must be unique within the schema (ANSI mode) or database.

Redefine the type with a new name or remove the existing name before
attempting to create your version.


-9997	No usage privilege on data type (<type-name>).

You do not hold the privilege to use this data type, which is a
DISTINCT data type that is based on a built-in data type. The
creator of this user-defined data type or a DBA must explicitly
grant you the Usage privilege on this data type.

You should ask a DBA or the owner of the cast to grant you
the Usage privilege on the cast.


-9998	No privilege to drop a cast of this DISTINCT data type.

You do not have the privilege to drop a cast of this DISTINCT type. By
default, after a DISTINCT type is defined, only the owner of the
DISTINCT type or a DBA can drop a cast for it. The owner of the
DISTINCT type, however, can grant to other users, to PUBLIC, or to
roles the Usage privilege on the DISTINCT type.

You should ask the DBA or the owner of the cast to drop the cast, or else
to grant you the Usage privilege on the cast so that you can drop it.


-9999	Routine collcompare() is not supported.

This routine always returns -1 and an error. The semantics of
the comparison are not defined.


-10000	Argument must be a variable to be an OUT or INOUT parameter.

The corresponding arguments to UDRs with OUT or INOUT parameters must be
specified as variables when the routine is called from a client such as
DRDA. Constants cannot be used as an argument for an OUT or INOUT parameter
in such cases.
